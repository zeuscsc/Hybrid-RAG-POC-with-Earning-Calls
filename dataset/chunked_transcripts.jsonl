I\u2019m joining you today from London and have alongside \nme Noel and Georges. I\u2019ll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel. \n \nAs you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board \nof his intention to retire from the bank after nearly five years in the role. The Board and I would \nlike to pay tribute to Noel\u2019s exceptional leadership during that time. As Group Chief Executive, \nhe drove both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business \nthrough the disposal of assets in the US, France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver \nan improved performance, achieving record profits last year, and create a platform for future \ngrowth and development. Noel, who you\u2019ll hear from in a second, has decided it\u2019s the right time \nto step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. \n \nAs you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already \nhave started a robust and rigorous process to find our next Group Chief Executive. This process \nwill look at both internal and external candidates. I\u2019m very pleased that Noel has agreed to \nremain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition, and, \non a personal note, I\u2019d like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to \nHSBC, which he joined 37 years ago. Noel, it has been a pleasure and privilege to work with \nand alongside you. \n \nNOEL QUINN, GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE: Thank you, Mark. I\u2019m very grateful for your \nsupport, guidance, friendship and partnership. I\u2019m proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I \nhave achieved together over the past five years. Over that period, we have hit some significant \nmilestones \u2013 record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade, and the highest dividend \nsince 2008. As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we \nhave built a strong platform for the bank\u2019s next phase of development and growth.","hash":"6edb38b98f6be71f8d70452e04853436","approximate_tokens_size":500}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"That\u2019s why \nI feel this is the right time to step back, to find a better balance between my personal and \nbusiness commitments, with the intention, going forward, after a break, of pursuing a portfolio \ncareer. \n \nWhen I reflect back on the last 37 years, I have held intensive leadership roles, particularly \nsince I took over the UK Commercial Bank in October 2008. After 16 years of intensive \nleadership, I\u2019m ready for a change, but it\u2019s also a natural inflection point for the bank as it comes \nto the end of the current transformation phase. It\u2019s an ideal time to bring in new leadership. The \nBoard has now started a process to find my successor, and I\u2019m very happy to continue in my \nrole as that process takes place. Rest assured, I will be working hard to ensure a smooth and \norderly transition for my successor and to keep the momentum going in this business as you \nhave seen in Q1. Until then, it\u2019s business as usual, so let\u2019s now turn to our Q1 results, which \nhave showed continued progress. \n \nWe had a good first quarter. Reported profit before tax was $12.7 billion. Excluding notable \nitems, profit before tax was $9 billion. Our return on tangible equity was 16.4% excluding \nnotable items. I\u2019m also pleased with the further capital distributions of $8.8 billion, which brings \nthe total amount of distributed capital by way of dividends and buybacks over the last 15 months \nto almost $28 billion, and we are on track to meet all of our previously communicated guidance \nfor 2024. I will now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers. \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY, GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER: Thank you, Noel. I\u2019d like to \nopen by paying tribute to the enormous contribution Noel has made to the bank. I\u2019ve greatly \nenjoyed working alongside him, and I know everyone at the bank has appreciated his strong \nand effective leadership. I\u2019m also grateful for the support he has shown me personally since \nmy appointment as CFO 15 months ago. The Board has announced a process to find a \nsuccessor, and I know Noel and I will continue to remain very focused on the job at hand until \nthat process has been completed.","hash":"2173e1e3216b937f9f2afb763df9836f","approximate_tokens_size":496}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Turning now to the numbers. \n \nReported profit before tax of $12.7 billion was down $0.3 billion on the first quarter of 2023 on \na constant currency basis. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, down \n$0.4 billion on last year\u2019s first quarter. On an annualised basis, we delivered a return on tangible \nequity of 26.1% or 16.4% excluding notable items. We completed the $2 billion share buyback \nannounced in February in two months. This means that, since the end of 2022, we have bought \nback 6% of our outstanding shares, and the trend of strong shareholder distributions continues \nthis quarter. We have announced, as Noel said, a further $8.8 billion of distributions consisting \nof first interim dividend for 2024 of 10 cents per share, the special dividend of 21 cents per \nshare from the Canada sale proceeds, and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion, which we \nplan to begin right after the AGM and complete within three months. Finally, we are \nreconfirming all of our 2024 guidance, including a mid-teens return on tangible equity excluding \nnotable items and our commitment to limit cost growth to around 5% on a target basis. \n \nSo, on the next slide, reported profit before tax of $12.7 billion included a $4.8 billion gain on \nthe sale of Canada, partly offset by the $1.1 billion impairment on the classification of Argentina \nas held for sale. Excluding notable items, profit before tax was $9 billion, with revenue growth \noffset primarily by higher costs and ECLs. Revenue of $20.8 billion was up $0.5 billion on the \nfirst quarter of last year. Excluding notable items, revenue was $17 billion, which was up \n$0.5 billion on the first quarter of last year with growth in Banking NII partly offset by lower Fee \nand other income. Within that, we saw high single-digit growth in multi-jurisdictional revenue in \nthe first quarter, which underlines the value of our global network. Banking NII of $11.3 billion \nwas up $0.6 billion on the fourth quarter on a reported FX basis, mainly driven by Argentina \nBanking NII as well as the non-recurrence of the cashflow hedge reclassification in the last \nquarter. \n \nLooking ahead to the rest of the year, a few things to keep in mind.","hash":"81e94bca11d50c26fc9bb40e24500ec9","approximate_tokens_size":500}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"First, our Q1 Banking NII \nincluded $0.3 billion from Canada, which will not repeat in future quarters due to the completion \nof the sale in March this year. Second, first-quarter Banking NII also included $0.5 billion from \nArgentina. This contribution will continue to be highly volatile until the sale is completed, which \nwe expect to be within the next 12 months. Please, therefore, do not extrapolate the $0.5 billion \nrun-rate for the remainder of the year. Our Banking NII guidance assumes the contribution of \naround $1 billion in full year 2024 for Argentina, which is in line with full year 2023. Third, the \nBanking NII outlook has improved in several respects since we announced our full-year results \nin February. The Hong Kong time deposit mix remains stable as a percentage of customer \ndeposits in the quarter, and markets are now pricing in more modest cuts to interest rates. \nHowever, it is still early in the year, and these things can change, so we are maintaining our \n2024 Banking NII guidance of at least $41 billion. \n \nTurning to fee and other income. Wholesale Transaction Banking was down by 9%, primarily \ndue to the normalisation of FX revenues compared to a very strong Foreign Exchange \nperformance in the first quarter of last year, which benefitted from higher market volatility. Fees \nfrom Global Payments Solutions had another good quarter, up by 6%. Wealth is another growth \narea that had a very good quarter, up by 14% on the same period last year as our investment \ncontinued to drive improved results. Private Banking was a standout performer, mainly driven \nby increased customer activity in brokerage and trading in Asia, but growth in Wealth has been \nbroad-based. To illustrate this, we acquired around 135,000 new-to-bank retail Wealth \ncustomers in Hong Kong in the quarter. Approximately 60% of these were non-residents \nattracted by our service and product capabilities in Hong Kong. \n \nBuilding on previous quarters, we attracted $27 billion of net new invested assets, of which \n$19 billion were in Asia, and our insurance new business CSM was $0.8 billion, up from \n$0.4 billion in the first quarter of last year.  \n \nOn credit, expected credit losses were $0.7 billion in the quarter, equivalent to 30 basis points \nof average loans.","hash":"706468c80201e3bc6ba814710eb3661e","approximate_tokens_size":498}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"These were primarily stage three charges across Retail and Wholesale. \nThere was a $54 million charge related to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. \nWhile challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it \nthan last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue \nmonitoring developments closely, and we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around \n40 basis points of average loans, recognising the overall uncertainty from the flowthrough effect \nof high interest rates on the economy. \n \nNext, we\u2019re on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target \nbasis. This quarter\u2019s year-on-year cost growth was impacted by three items. First, we chose to \nphase the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. \nThis accounted for two percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently \nexpect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023, \nso the accrual will be lower over the next three quarters than it was in the same period last \nyear. \n \nSecond, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to one percentage point of cost growth this \nquarter, as we only acquired SVB UK in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide \nyou with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I\u2019m pleased that it has good \nmomentum. In the UK, we onboarded 183 new-to-bank Innovation Banking client groups in the \nquarter, the best quarter since acquisition. \n \nFinally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank of \nEngland Levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost \ndiscipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a \ntarget basis inclusive of all the above items. \n \nOn lending and deposits, there was good loan growth in the UK, the Middle East, Mexico and \nAsia excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remained subdued, largely due to the \nhigh interest rate differential with mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect \nmid-single-digit loan growth over the medium-to-long term, but we expect demand to remain \nsubdued in the near term.","hash":"690687f707f60ddb0435d0df98de81cf","approximate_tokens_size":500}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Deposits were down 2%. This was due to a range of factors including \nseasonality, the switch from time deposits to wealth products in Hong Kong and our deliberate \nchoice to forsake some highly price-sensitive deposits. \n \nNext, our CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 40 basis points on the fourth quarter. Organic capital \ngeneration and the gain from the sale of the Canadian business enabled us to announce \n$8.8 billion of capital distributions this quarter. This includes a share buyback of up to $3 billion, \nwhich is expected to have an impact of around 40 basis points on our CET1 ratio in the second \nquarter. For modelling purposes, please note that the $5.8 billion of dividends announced \ntoday, as well as the $5.9 billion in respect of the ordinary dividend announced at the full-year \nresults in February will both be reflected in TNAV in the second quarter. \n \nAt closing of the sale of HSBC Argentina, which is expected within 12 months, we will also \nrecognise $4.9 billion of foreign exchange reserve recycling losses, subject to any movement \nin this reserve up until completion. These losses have already been accumulated in capital \nover the previous years. Therefore, recognition in the P&L will have no impact on CET1, nor \non TNAV. \n \nFinally, looking forward to the rest of the year, our good first quarter puts us on track, and we \nare reconfirming all of our 2024 guidance \u2013 a mid-teens return on tangible equity excluding \nnotable items, a Banking NII of at least $41 billion, ECLs of around 40 basis points, cost growth \nlimited to around 5% on a target basis, and a 50% dividend payout ratio.  \n \nWith that, Louise, can we please go to Q&A? \n \nJOSEPH DICKERSON, JEFFERIES: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, \ncongratulations Noel on a great tenure at the bank, and well done for the ROE and the capital \nreturn. Just in terms of my question, the TD migration in Hong Kong, if you go back to the way \nyou were computing it previously, it actually looks like it improved quarter on quarter, and \ncertainly under the new definition has stabilised. Is that a little bit better than where your \nexpectations were a few months ago?","hash":"d83709e465af512b32fe51e8388bf83f","approximate_tokens_size":490}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I know when I was in Hong Kong recently it sounded \nlike things were starting to stabilise, but is that better than where you were thinking a few \nmonths ago? \n \nSecondly, on the buybacks, is the $3 billion number due more to the calendar effect or are you \nlooking to boost the run rate there from the $2 billion a quarter? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Joseph. So first, on the time deposit reclassification, we \nhave actually reclassified some Private Bank term deposits to time deposits. This is due to the \nobservation of their behaviour and the recognition that they\u2019re better classified as time deposits. \nThis rebases the number, but, as you could see from the two charts we have, it does not affect \nthe trend, so therefore the trend that we\u2019ve seen under both classifications is the same and \nwe\u2019ve seen the first quarter stable, quarter on quarter. It\u2019s too early to call it a peak, but we\u2019ve \nalways expected migration this year to be slower than what we\u2019ve seen last year, and this just \nconfirms the trend change from what we\u2019ve seen in full-year 2023. \n \nAs regards your buyback question, so the short answer is yes, this is indeed due to calendar \neffects. We just completed a $2 billion buyback in two months. That\u2019s about a billion a month. \nThat is the fastest run-rate we\u2019ve done in terms of share buybacks ever. We are now \nannouncing a $3 billion buyback which we intend to do over the next three months, starting \nafter AGM. We will see how it goes with the $1 billion run rate. We will see how it will go. \n \nAs regards any future amount of buyback or whether we\u2019re doing a buyback, one, it remains \nour intention to return excess capital to our shareholders through a rolling series of share \nbuyback, and second, we will decide on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on our capital \noutlook, the loan growth outlook and other parameters as and when every quarter.  \n \nRAUL SINHA, JP MORGAN: Thanks very much for taking my questions, maybe two from me \nas well.","hash":"df112945fb781dd121b77bd02bc03b43","approximate_tokens_size":464}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Just staying, Georges, on this point on distributions and looking at the moving parts for \ncapital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering \nif you could give us a little bit more colour on the growth in RWAs, the $7 billion of increase \ndriven by asset quality trends. I think you\u2019re calling out that it\u2019s predominantly in Asia. What \nshould we think about the outlook for RWA growth from here, even if loan growth is muted, just \nto get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in quantum terms for distributions? \n \nThe second question is to Noel: a question for your broader thoughts, Noel. The five years \npreceding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC but I guess for a lot of people in \nyour markets, given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited \nCanada, you announced Argentina. You\u2019re in the process of exiting quite a few smaller \nmarkets. The return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You\u2019re buying back stock at \n$3 billion a quarter. You\u2019ve got a special dividend as well. I guess what I\u2019m really interested in \nis from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to progress? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: I\u2019ll start with your first question, Raul. First, on RWA outlook, of the \nRWA growth we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis $24 billion. First, about 40% of it relate to \nlending and other asset growth, and as you can see from our lending book, we\u2019ve grown our \nlending book by $5 billion. There are a number of areas of growth that contributed to around \n40% of it, $9 billion. Then we\u2019ve had a $5 billion market risk RWA growth; this is due to a pickup \nin MSS activity against a subdued Q4, and it\u2019s more in line with their activity levels in the first \nthree quarters of the year, if you want. This is the normalisation of Markets activity. \n \nAnd then there is $7 billion which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, \nfirst, it is a continuous exercise. We do this portfolio monitoring review on a regular basis.","hash":"d5dcecb38c1b4651f991f2eef6517616","approximate_tokens_size":497}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"We \nhave recognised, across a number of geographies and a number of sectors, certain names \nwhich we\u2019ve decided to downgrade on the basis that the interest rate pressure on their cash \nflows has been more severe. You will not see an equivalent of that downgrade in ECL, and \nthat\u2019s mainly because for many of these customers their balance sheet remains strong, so \nwe\u2019re comfortable with their balance sheet and therefore there is no ECL implication from this \ndowngrade. But just closing the loop on this RWA downgrade, you will see some of it \nmaterialised in our stage three loans, where we increased our stage three loans by about \n$2 billion, and that\u2019s exactly the mapping of some of this asset quality. \n \nWith regards how we look forward, we\u2019re very comfortable where we are today. Our credit \nmetrics remain solid. As I say, the balance sheets of our customers remain strong for a number \nof them, for at least the exposure that is collateralised. We\u2019re very comfortable with the level of \ncollateralisation and the LTV, and therefore we do not foresee at this stage today any additional \naction we should be taking. We will obviously monitor the book on a regular basis as we always \ndo. Noel? \n \nNOEL QUINN: Thank you. It has certainly been an extraordinary five years, as you say, not \njust for HSBC but for the world. I\u2019m really pleased and grateful. I want to pay tribute to the team \nfor the way they\u2019ve collectively navigated that, and during that whole process the external \nenvironment executed on a complex but absolutely critical transformation plan over the past \nfive years. The outcome of that hard work is evident in the financial performance last year and \nthe financial performance in Q1. \n \nI also want to say thanks to Mark. With such volatility in an external environment any CEO \nneeds the support of their Chair, their advice, their guidance, and I\u2019ve had that all the way \nthrough. I\u2019ve had the support from the Board all the way through in navigating what has been \na very complex external environment, but the team, the Board, Mark, collectively, we\u2019ve done \na good job of navigating it.","hash":"a1501360d40e64e52bfa19ca790207c2","approximate_tokens_size":482}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Now, if I look forward I\u2019m not going to give a to-do list to my successor, because that is not the \nfair thing to do to anyone, but I will give you some thoughts about what we as a team are very \nmuch focused on and I\u2019m focused on for as long as I\u2019m still CEO, and that is continuing the \nmomentum. You don\u2019t work as hard as we\u2019ve worked for the past five years and then take the \neye off the ball at this moment in time, so I\u2019m very focused on a smooth, orderly transition. I\u2019m \nvery focused on continued execution of the strategy. \n \nI want to clarify our thinking on one element of the strategy. We have exited a lot of businesses, \na lot of RWAs over the past five years. The one thing we\u2019ve protected whilst doing that is the \ninternational core of HSBC. The countries we remain in and the businesses we remain in are \nfundamentally now focused on the international nature and essence of HSBC, and we will \ncontinue to do that. Our key requirement is to continue to deliver good returns that are \nsustainable and repeatable, whilst also taking advantage of the growth opportunities as they \nemerge in a world that becomes more stable and that are inherent in our customer franchise. \nTherefore, we\u2019re very focused on continuing the development of wealth, our transaction \nbanking capabilities, our global wholesale banking capabilities, and then being ready for when \ncorporate loan demand picks up we can take advantage of that to couple good returns with \nsustainable growth. I think you\u2019ve seen evidence of that in these results. \n \nHong Kong is subdued at the moment, but we understand why, with the rate differential in \nChina. But, if you look at the rest of the world \u2013 as Georges said \u2013 there\u2019s balance sheet growth \nin wholesale banking, in the rest of Asia, in the Middle East, in UK, in Europe. We\u2019re seeing \ngood growth elsewhere, so it\u2019s about focus, momentum, continuing to couple good returns with \ngood growth. \n \nJEREMY HOU, CICC: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first question is \non deposits.","hash":"0afafc41b9241bede2352c5d1d3a93c2","approximate_tokens_size":478}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"We\u2019re glad to see that the CASA migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but it\u2019s \nnot stabilised at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit \noutflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So I\u2019m \nwondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and CASA for you at this \nstage, and how do you see that trend in the rest of the year? \n \nThe second question is on the structural hedge. I\u2019m wondering if this quarter you could share \nwith us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the \nreinvestment of the structural hedge, and if there is any run rate that we can refer to? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Jeremy. So on your first question about deposits in Hong \nKong, if you remember at Q4 our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. \nWhat we\u2019ve seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion, therefore you can see \nseasonality playing across the two quarters and therefore is broadly stable across the two \nquarters. What happened, though, is some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some \ndeposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. When you look \nat Q1, while you see the deposit outflows you also can see that $19 billion of our net new \ninvested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated \ninto wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains, if you \nwant, the seasonality of these deposits.  \n \nSecond, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and enviable \nfranchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail \nand wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. \nThroughout the last six quarters you\u2019ve seen how our deposit base has been very stable, with \nour deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers, therefore I won\u2019t \ncomment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers.","hash":"e71c3dfea76cfd6ac2666b54923a551a","approximate_tokens_size":484}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge, first you would have noticed \nthat we increased this quarter the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 billion, \nwith the weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of three years. Second, we commit \nat this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously this will remain subject to \nmarket conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market \noutlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward \nBanking NII, and this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted, as you know, and you \ncan do the maths. \n \nBut equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates, and this \nreinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into Banking NII. \nBetween the two of those effects the structural hedge activity for the full-year 2024 would \nremain a net tailwind to our Banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind. \nWe\u2019re looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space, but that tailwind has been factored \ninto our guidance of \u2018at least $41 billion Banking NII\u2019, and obviously factored into our return on \ntangible equity mid-teens guidance.  \n \nJASON NAPIER, UBS: First of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of \nyour career and private life; I think a well-earned rebalancing. Georges, I just wondered whether \nyou\u2019d talk a little bit within the context of \u2018higher for longer\u2019. You\u2019ve referenced subdued loan \ndemand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates, and I just wonder whether \u2013 one \nof your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as \nloan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue, so I wonder whether you \nmight talk a little bit about whether that\u2019s a material part of the plan and what you think that \nmeans for revenue evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat \nsurprised that we didn\u2019t see an upgrade to Banking NII guidance this quarter.","hash":"f9abd3712836d8f7e4ceb81a354911e4","approximate_tokens_size":489}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I know you don\u2019t \nrebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that \u2018higher for \nlonger\u2019 has on asset mix and then on credit demand. \n \nAnd then secondly, Wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there\u2019s a part of the business that\u2019s \nquite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now up 20% in a short \nspace of time, but I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. \nIs that the strategy delivering the net new money flows, or is there an element of market volatility \nin there that we should be a little bit careful about? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Jason. So first on Banking NII, we recognise there are a \ncouple of encouraging developments. The first one is the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 on the rate side \nthat will look more favourable than when we discussed last in February, and the second one \nwe just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we\u2019ve \nseen term deposit remain stable for this quarter. So we recognise these tailwinds to our \nBanking NII, but we also recognise it\u2019s quite early in the year and these factors can still change. \nThis is why we didn\u2019t change our guidance. As you said, Jason, I don\u2019t think you should expect \nus to update our guidance every quarter. We will reconsider this every quarter, but for this \nquarter we\u2019re just sticking with our at least $41 billion. \n \nIn terms of the Wealth performance, so recognise mid-teens percentage growth in Wealth, 34% \nfor our Private Bank, I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that \nwe\u2019ve already said it\u2019s a focus strategic area. We are investing in this area. A big part of our \ninvestments goes towards this area, and we\u2019re very pleased to see the results of our \ninvestments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new invested assets \ngrowth. You can see that through our CSM, with new business CSM growth in insurance, as \nwell as in the actual revenue performance.","hash":"0d63d84a7d1320eccc590a037505dc1d","approximate_tokens_size":481}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"This being said, I would just caution you not to annualise the numbers you\u2019re seeing, because \nQ1 2023 had somewhat a subdued January in it, when mainland China and Hong Kong were \nstill closed, so therefore you\u2019ve seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 2023 at the back end of \nit, whereas we had a full proper Q1 2024, so there is an element of not annualising the \nperformance, but expecting that performance to continue growing. \n \nI just realised I didn\u2019t touch on your asset mix question. Look, we do not foresee a material \nchange in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year the main growth \ntake place in mortgages, and recognising mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in \nthe UK and Hong Kong and the margins have been quite tight, as we start seeing pick up in \nwholesale demand, as we start seeing pick up in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that \nthose will drive higher margins than what we\u2019ve seen in mortgages. Our numbers in Q1 did \nshow that this pick up definitely is there in areas of Asia, south-east Asia, India, the Middle \nEast, the UK, etc. The next in line for that pick up will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some \nstage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease. \n \nPERLIE MONG, KBW: Thank you for taking my question. Can I just dig a little bit further into \nJason\u2019s question just now on \u2018higher for longer\u2019? I know you probably don\u2019t like to comment on \nlonger-term NII, but in a higher-for-longer rate environment how are you thinking about the \ntrajectory going from here? It sounds to me that deposit migration has probably stabilised a lot, \nand I would have thought any lower pricing that hasn\u2019t already come through will come through \nin the next few months. In a higher-for-longer rate environment you can probably build more \nhedges at better rates as well, etc, and there\u2019s obviously a tailwind, as you mentioned, this year \nalready. How does that inform your thinking on your medium-term ROTE? That\u2019s the first \nquestion. \n \nThe second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit.","hash":"298e9b1df7aa27b2e6d511d83324a45c","approximate_tokens_size":492}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I guess just \nnoting your point that Hong Kong might be the next in line to pick up, but I guess overall the \nEmerging Markets are probably not benefitting in terms of activity levels and in terms of capital \ninflows from the higher US rates. How does that impact trading activities, capital flows, etc? \nHow are you thinking about the flip side of \u2018higher for longer\u2019? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Perlie. First, yes, we recognise \u2018higher for longer\u2019 is \ndefinitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we\u2019ve forecast in our Banking NII. And as I \nsaid, there have been a number of manifestations of tailwinds now compared to when we last \nspoke in February, but equally it is early in the year, and, as you\u2019ve seen, these things do \nchange. We therefore want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing \nparameters. We will update longer than what we\u2019re updating, but not at this quarter, Perlie. Do \nexpect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say \nthe one parameter just to keep in mind as you start planning for 2025 is to take Argentina out, \nbecause obviously subject to the sale completing \u2013 which we expect to complete in the next \n12 months \u2013 that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our Banking \nNII. That\u2019s the most predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025. \n \nIn terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the Wealth performance just \ndemonstrates how Wealth remains very resilient, and that\u2019s particularly true in Hong Kong, but \nvery much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our Transaction Banking activities \u2013 apart \nfrom Foreign Exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 2023 with a very high volatility \n\u2013 has performed across the various areas of its fee-earning activities. \n \nAnd then our activity is very much benefitting from cross-border trends; if you look at some of \nthe investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra-region in Asia \nbetween China and ASEAN, between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, etc, all \nof those trends are growing.","hash":"700dea2f4ee343038d761990a336a12e","approximate_tokens_size":493}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I mean, the numbers are staggering in some cases. These are the \nactivities that our business is operating on, so therefore we \u2013 while recognising that there will \nbe some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong \nunderlying network activity which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in Wholesale \nTransaction Banking and Wealth. \n \nPERLIE MONG: On that, I\u2019ve also noticed that China exports and volumes have been going \nup but value has been coming down. That is in part because of various things; FX is a big part \nof it, but also government subsidies. How does that affect your profitability in the region? Your \nvolume is going up but the value is going down. \n \nNOEL QUINN: Perlie, if I can just give you an indication, what we are seeing at the moment is \na very strong level of activity of China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia. Our \noutbound activity from mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase \nin activity over the past 12 months. We\u2019ve seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this \nyear. A lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down, but what I would \nsay is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a \npace, a very significant pace. We\u2019re very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are \ncapturing that outflow. \n \nOur business in mainland China performed well last year. It\u2019s performing well again in the first \nquarter of this year, and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. We\u2019ll give more \nupdates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. That is why, actually, I think the rest \nof Asia is performing well on balance sheet, because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia \nactivity and outbound from mainland China. \n \nKATHERINE LEI, JP MORGAN: I have three questions. The first one is on non-interest income. \nI look at the breakdown on non-interest income. It seems like Wealth is doing quite well, but on \nTransaction Banking there is some weakness. I think it\u2019s down 9% worldwide. Can we know \nwhat is the reason?","hash":"5bac9e050b61747a24a172b3d3c519a1","approximate_tokens_size":497}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? \nThis is the first one. \n \nThe second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically \u2013 not \nonly LTV, but they relaxed the purchase requirements and the stamp duty requirements on \nresidential properties, so I think there is a significant jump in transactions. I was thinking that \nthis should be positive to mortgages at least, and then we are big mortgage providers in \nHong Kong. Would that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related \nto Hong Kong? That\u2019s the second one. \n \nAnd then the last one, I think, is on cost. If I look at the first quarter I think cost is up 8%, \nincluding levy. How should I look at this? Are we on track to the 5% cost growth this year? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Katherine. I\u2019ll take questions one and three, and I\u2019ll hand \nover to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. First, on \nnon-NII, Wealth has performed well. Transaction Banking weakness is specifically due to \nForeign Exchange. That\u2019s driving the whole weakness. The reason, as I called it out earlier, \nthe reasons that Foreign Exchange had a very strong and a record strong Q1 2023 is on the \nback of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis, so \ntherefore we\u2019re doing a comparison to a record quarter and it will show that drop, but if you \nlook at the number itself, at the revenue itself for Foreign Exchange, it is back to normalised \nlevels, so there is nothing to worry about here. It\u2019s, on the contrary, back to normalised levels.  \n \nWe continue to expect some cyclicality in that space while we continue expecting growth in the \nother areas of Transaction Banking, so I wouldn\u2019t read more than that into it. We remain very \nconfident that the investment we\u2019re putting both in Wealth and in Transaction Banking and in \nthe technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain a strategic focus and \nare bearing results as we look into future quarters and years.","hash":"8a45342ea1f218584ef551a8775f31e0","approximate_tokens_size":482}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"On your third question about costs, first, I just want to reiterate it is a clear priority for us to \nmaintain cost discipline. We\u2019re very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target \nbasis. We\u2019re confident about it, and we\u2019re actually on track to do so. The reason why we\u2019re on \ntrack to do so yet we showed a 7% Q1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic \nitems related to the quarter which are not repeated in future quarters, or some of them will \nreverse in future quarters. I\u2019ll just call the three of them out that matter. \n \nFirst, there was a 2% accrual of the performance related pay, where we decided to phase that \naccrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher \nperformance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will \ncontribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full-year basis we are not accruing \nto a significantly different number than the full-year 2023 performance-related pay. \n \nSecond, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter, because last \nyear\u2019s first quarter we only acquired SVB in the middle of March, which means we practically \ndidn\u2019t have it in the first quarter last year, and that\u2019s a base effect. \n \nThird, we had the one-offs or the expected non-recurrence of the FDIC special assessment \nadditional charge this quarter, as well as the Bank of England Levy, a new charge which used \nto be an interest expense in NII, and now it\u2019s moved to operational expense, as in costs. \nBetween the two of them they contributed to 1%. So if you adjust for those and you bake them \nin, we still remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year, or circa 5% on a full-year \nbasis. On your second question I\u2019ll hand over to Noel about Hong Kong. \n \nNOEL QUINN: Katherine, I was in Hong Kong recently and spoke to a number of the market \nparticipants there and the developers.","hash":"29a189fd56bc14aaf4e35f9d2c4f4e72","approximate_tokens_size":465}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Firstly, I think the change \u2013 the stamp duty arrangements \nin Hong Kong in March in the budget \u2013 was very well received, and it\u2019s had a positive impact \non the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely \nsignificant inflow of activity in the first month; that will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions \nof many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilises, because \nundoubtedly there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were \nanticipating some change, therefore there was low activity in the preceding months. I think \nwe\u2019ve got to see how that stabilises, but I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance \nliquidity within the market, it will enhance activity in the mortgage market, but I think it\u2019s too \nearly to call it a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilises following those \nchanges, but a very helpful intervention. \n \nANDREW COOMBS, CITI: Firstly, just to commend Noel as well on his five years as CEO, but \nalso to acknowledge your long stint at HSBC beforehand too. Two questions, please. Firstly, \non the UK NIM, you\u2019ve seen an improvement for a second consecutive quarter, another six \nbasis points, so outperforming some of the domestic peers. I can see your loans and deposit \nbalances look fairly flat in that entity. Perhaps you could just comment on what you\u2019re seeing \nin terms of deposit migration, mortgage re-fi, and what\u2019s driving that NIM improvement and how \nsustainable you think that improvement is going forward as well? \n \nThe second one is just a clarification on Argentina. You booked $0.5 billion in Q1, guiding to \n$1 billion for the full year based on last year\u2019s experience. Presumably what you\u2019re therefore \nsaying is a step down to $0.2 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year, given that you \ndon\u2019t expect the transaction to necessarily close until 12 months\u2019 time? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Andrew. The UK NIM was up six basis points indeed. It \nessentially benefitted from some idiosyncrasies of structural hedges and timing of structural \nhedge maturities and reinvestments.","hash":"5cf8070e456e26cb68bcddfe52b4f282","approximate_tokens_size":486}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"So if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of \nplus or minus 10 basis points, I would say UK NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of \nquarters, and we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. You will therefore add to \nthat broadly flat some structural hedge idiosyncrasies, which will drive you within this plus or \nminus 10 basis point range. \n \nYes, our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the UK economy has been resilient. \nWe\u2019re very optimistic about the outlook for the UK, specifically around inflation and \nemployment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us, it remains a very important \nmarket for us, and we continue gaining market share. I mean, we continue gaining market \nshare in mortgages, with a 10% new business market share. Our back book market share has \nmoved from \u2013 or our overall portfolio market share has moved from 7% to 8%. We are 25% \nmarket share in SME lending, and obviously we continue investing in this business. You can \nlook at the ring-fenced bank cost growth and how much we can support cost and investment \ngrowth for the ring-fenced bank within our overall circa 5% cost growth. All this demonstrates \nthe confidence we have in our business in the UK, our clients activity in the UK and the outlook \nfor the UK. \n \nIf I move to Argentina, I wish I could give you a trend for Argentina. The way it works is the \nnumbers balloon with hyperinflation and then they shrink with devaluation. It depends how they \nmanifest themselves over month over month. Q4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some \nlevel, but they have seen a massive devaluation; if you recall, in December we\u2019ve seen more \nthan 50% currency devaluation. That\u2019s contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking \nNII in Argentina brought to Q4, and then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We\u2019ve seen 6% \nonly, but we\u2019ve seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers. It will be volatile quarter \non quarter, and our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged \nout over last year, which is around $1 billion.","hash":"1f96ca92470c34cb7f0ca5158ac8512a","approximate_tokens_size":497}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Now, just looking at the overall Argentina, if you take in the non-banking NII and you take in \nthe cost base, etc, last year\u2019s Argentina contribution to our PBT was $0.2 billion. Just to put it \nin perspective, this is about one cent earnings per share or half a cent dividend per share. \nTherefore, I think as you look at the full-year 2024 that\u2019s the quantum that Argentina volatility \nwill create, so it should not distract you from the way you\u2019re forecasting the bank\u2019s outcomes. \n \nANDREW COOMBS: I guess just to follow up on this, in a scenario whereby you didn\u2019t have \nany devaluation of peso and inflation was a more moderate, normal amount, what would the \nNII contribution be under that more BAU scenario a quarter for Argentina? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Again, it\u2019s a difficult one to say, but if you just do the arithmetic of our \n$1 billion expected for the full year, of which already $0.5 billion has manifested in the first \nquarter, a smoothed-out outcome would be the other $0.5 billion phased out evenly over three \nquarters, but that\u2019s a highly volatile number so I wouldn\u2019t use it as a forecast. \n \nANDREW COOMBS: Understood.

In my \nremarks, I will be comparing year-on-year on an underlying basis and speaking to constant currency \nunless stated otherwise. And as a reminder, the results of our segments and products are now \npresented to reflect the RNS we issued on the 2nd of April.  \nSlide 2 \u2013 Opening remarks \nWe had a strong start to 2024. First quarter income was up 20%. This growth rate was flattered by \ntwo notable items totalling $234 million, but even excluding this, income was up 14%. Adjusted net \ninterest income increased 5%, and the performance of our two engines of non-NII was strong with \nWealth Solutions up 23% and Markets up 17%. We saw good momentum in Banking with income up \nby a similar amount at 17%. With mid-single-digit expense growth and modest loan impairments, pre-\ntax profit was up 27%. We remain highly liquid. Our CET1 ratio remains robust and the latest $1 billion \nshare buyback is progressing well. We have also made good progress on our simplification agenda. \nWe announced changes to our organisational structure, removed the regional metrics and are \nmobilising the group around Fit For Growth. Lastly, we are maintaining our 2024 guidance in line with \nwhat we presented at our full year 2023 results. So all in all, a very good start to the year.  \nSlide 3 \u2013 Strong performance in Q1\u201924 \nTurning now to look at our performance in more detail. Looking at the various components of income. \nNII was up 5%, benefiting for just 1 month from the roll-off of the remaining component of the short \nhedge at the end of February and the higher NIM.","hash":"69b9e39fa41155db5a8c7cf1a6642723","approximate_tokens_size":476}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Non-NII was up 37%, driven by strong performances \nin both Wealth Solutions and Markets and positive momentum in Banking. More on that later. \nExpenses were up 6%. Credit impairment remains low and predominantly relates to the WRB \nportfolio, with the charge in line with recent quarters. The $60 million charge in other impairment was \nprimarily related to write-off of software assets with no impact on capital. The strong double-digit \nincome growth, positive jaws and low levels of impairment drove underlying profit before tax of $2.1 \nbillion, up 27%.  \nOther items include a $100 million provision for customers who incurred losses in Korea on their \ninvestment in equity-linked securities. This reflects our participation in a compensation scheme in line \nwith the recommendations of the Korean Financial Supervisory Service. Taxes in the quarter reflect an \nunderlying effective tax rate of 26%, and we continue to expect the full year 2024 underlying effective \n \nPUBLIC \ntax rate to be broadly similar to last year. We saw some underlying asset growth in the quarter despite \nthe higher for longer rate environment, mainly in CIB.  \nTangible net asset value per share was down slightly quarter-on-quarter with profit accretion offset \nby the full $1 billion share buyback impact and reserve movements such as FX and own credit \nadjustment. You will have seen that we now show a full TNAV walk in the appendices to the slide \npresentation. Adjusted net interest income was up 1% quarter-on-quarter to just over $2.4 billion. \nThere were a number of factors driving this increase. The expiry of the last $12.5 billion of our short-\nterm hedges at the end of February, reinvested at higher yields, provided a $42 million benefit for 1 \nmonth in March. We also saw an improvement in the liabilities mix. These benefits were partially \noffset by a lower margin, which reduced net interest income by $52 million as the currency weighted \ninterest rate across our key footprint currencies in the quarter was slightly lower and deposit pass-\nthrough rates increased.  \nSlide 4 \u2013 Higher NII supported by hedge roll-off and mix improvements \nAverage interest earning assets of $554 billion were down 1%, reducing NII by around $20 million.","hash":"635bac9b41a15e76b1faae6341e3d7e4","approximate_tokens_size":480}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to expect NII of $10 billion to $10.25 billion \nin 2024. There are a number of factors that play here. Firstly, the currency weighted average forward \ncurve we have provided in Slide 15 of the appendices to our presentation points to reduced \nheadwinds. In February, we showed our expected currency weighted forward market rate reduction \nof 51 basis points. This is now reduced to just 12 basis points based upon the curves of April 15. Secondly, \nwe expect to see further positive impact to NII from the mechanical benefit of the short-term hedges \nrolling off. This positive impact for NII will be somewhat offset, as you would expect, by reduced client \nasset demand in a higher-for-longer rate environment.  \nSlide 5 \u2013 Engines of Non NII performing strongly \nNow turning to non-NII, which was up 37%. I will cover the product performance in more detail later \nin the segment slides, but a few comments on the non-NII performance of our core businesses. Wealth \nSolutions, one of two engines of NII, was up 24% with broad-based growth across products. Markets, \nour other main engine of non-NII was up 13%, and Banking was 48%. Excluding the two notable items \nof $234 million that we will address now, non-NII was up 25%. The first of these notable items was a \nforeign exchange revaluation gain of $158 million in our Egyptian branch. This is booked in treasury \nproducts and arose as a result of the devaluation in the Egyptian pound. This has no impact on the \ngroup's capital position as the income is offset by a loss in the currency translation reserve. The second \nitem arose from Ghana being designated as a hyperinflationary economy for accounting purposes in \naccordance with IAS 29, which resulted in a gain of $76 million.  \nSlide 6 \u2013 Expenses higher from inflation and business growth \nNow turning to expenses. Expenses were up 6%, driven by inflation and business growth initiatives \nprimarily to support our higher returning businesses in CIB and our Affluent proposition. The Fit For \nGrowth program is in full mobilisation phase, having launched the initiative publicly just 10 weeks ago.","hash":"94e6c3d2d76cc8ce402fe3e82973c548","approximate_tokens_size":482}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"We are seeing good early progress as our colleagues at all levels embrace the opportunity. We have \nidentified over 200 projects currently being scoped and put into execution. The majority of which \nimpact multiple parts of the bank. This transversal approach will be a key characteristic of the \nprogram. And as I said earlier, we have taken action to simplify our organisational structure with the \n \nPUBLIC \nright leadership team in place to further sharpen the focus on driving strong, sustainably higher \nreturns through each business line.  \nWe also removed the regional management construct, thereby reducing complexity and simplifying \nthe matrix. This has led not just to a change in the way we report but a change in how we manage \nthe organisation, leading to improved speed of decision-making, increased agility and focus on \nsatisfying client needs. Just a reminder that the second quarter is usually seasonally higher than the \nfirst quarter with annual staff pay adjustments being effective from the 1st of April. We will manage \ncosts tightly. And as guided in February, we are committed to keeping costs below $12 billion in 2026, \nimplying a cost growth CAGR of 3% over the three years and targeting positive income to cost jaws \nin every year.  \nSlide 7 \u2013 Credit quality remains resilient \nTurning now to credit impairment. As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, our credit impairment \ncharge was just $26 million, mainly due to net releases. So whilst credit impairment in the first quarter \nof 2024 was up significantly over last year, with a charge of $176 million in the quarter, it remains \nrelatively low. In CIB, the overall charge was net nil. China commercial real estate impairment was just \n$10 million, net of a small overlay release. The cover level of our China Commercial Real Estate non-\nperforming portfolio is high at 90%. And we retain a management overlay of $129 million against \nfurther downside risk, given a sustainable recovery in price and sales is yet to occur.  \nAs mentioned earlier, in WRB, the expected credit loss charge of $136 million is in line with recent \nquarters. In Ventures, we saw a $28 million charge primarily from an increase in provisions in our digital \nBank, Mox.","hash":"79c98567716f87f29bf8550954d0e56c","approximate_tokens_size":494}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"This provision, which relates to the unsecured portfolio, encouragingly appears past the \npeak, with flow rates to default and delinquencies improving in both the legacy and the new book. \nWhilst we are clearly now in a period of higher-for-longer rates, we are not seeing any new problems \nemerging other than for portfolios that were already under stress. High risk assets were down $2 billion \nin the quarter. As I mentioned at the full year 2023 results, the temporary increase in credit grade 12 \nexposure reversed as expected in the first quarter. We also saw a reduction of around $600 million in \nthe Early Alerts portfolio from upgrades and repayments.  \nSlide 8 \u2013 Underlying growth in assets \nTouching briefly now on the balance sheet. On an underlying basis, customer loans and advances of \n$283 billion were up 2% or $4 billion in the quarter despite the higher-for-longer rate environment. We \ncontinued to deliberately hold back on new mortgage origination in Hong Kong due to unfavourable \npricing dynamics. And in Korea, mortgage demand is weak. As we have said before, we expect to see \nmortgage growth only later in our 3-year plan period. Whilst client demand for borrowing in a high \ninterest rate environment remains muted, encouragingly, we saw some growth in CIB Trade & \nWorking Capital, Markets and Banking, driven by client activity.  \nWe continue to expect asset growth to mostly come through later in 2024 with no change to our \nguidance of low single-digit percentage growth for the year. Customer deposits were down $6 billion \nin the quarter, excluding the impact of FX, to $459 billion. We continue to attract deposits in WRB, \nwhich increased by $3 billion. This was more than offset by a reduction in CIB CASA from month-end \nclient activity. Post-quarter end, we have seen these flows substantially returning. The liquidity \ncoverage ratio was broadly stable at 146%.  \n \nPUBLIC \nSlide 9 \u2013 CET1 ratio remains robust post share buyback \nTurning to capital. Risk-weighted assets of $252 billion were up 3% or $8 billion on the end of 2023. \nOperational risk RWA, which is mechanically calculated from the previous 3 years' income contributed \nto $2 billion of the increase in the quarter. This is a one-off increase for the full year.","hash":"ca3260e8c02db201475b7b2a06455a3a","approximate_tokens_size":497}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Higher RWA from \nchanges in asset mix was offset by an FX benefit from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Lastly, Market risk \nRWA grew by $4 billion. Clients reengaged post the seasonally quiet end to the calendar year.  \nAlthough volatility was not widespread in the quarter, we saw pockets of opportunities to help clients, \nparticularly in Greater China and Africa, and it generated an attractive return on risk-weighted assets \ndeployed. Market risk RWA from these client opportunities is expected to reduce in the second \nquarter, and we continue to guide to low single-digit percentage growth in overall RWA for full year \n2024.  \nThe CET1 story is simple. Deduction of the full $1 billion share buyback took the pro forma CET1 ratio \ndown 40 basis points to 13.6%. After accounting for this, our first quarter CET1 ratio was broadly stable \nwith equity generation from first quarter profits, offset by the increase in RWA.  \nSlide 10 \u2013 CIB: Momentum in high-returning businesses \nLet's look briefly at our large client segments. Turning first to CIB. Markets income up 17% was led by \nstrong double-digit growth in Macro Trading and Credit Trading. Flow income was up 5%. Episodic \nincome came back after a slow quarter last year, up 30% as we helped clients to capture volatility in \nsome of our key geographies. When we issued the RNS in April, we introduced a new product \ntaxonomy, which included splitting Financial Markets into Markets and Banking to give you a better \nwindow into products with similar income and balance sheet attributes. Banking was up 17% as a \nresult of higher client origination and execution of a good pipeline. We continue to increase the \nvelocity of our balance sheet by originating to distribute. Trade continues to lag. Global trade volumes \nare down, but we are maintaining overall market share across products and geographies.  \nSlide 11 \u2013 WRB: Wealth Solutions driving significant growth \nWRB also had a very strong quarter. Wealth Solutions income grew 23% with broad-based growth \nacross products. Our less market-sensitive income grew at a healthy clip as we began to monetise the \nquarter of a million new to bank, high-quality Affluent clients that we onboarded last year.","hash":"67fe38828ca0f868156dec4f5df99598","approximate_tokens_size":481}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"The \nleading indicators continued to be robust, with sustained momentum in Affluent new-to-bank clients, \nparticularly in Hong Kong, Singapore and China. Of the net new money flows of $11 billion in the first \nquarter of the year, $7 billion or around 70% were deployed into Wealth products, and the balance \nwas from Deposits. The mix shift we have seen developing towards Wealth products accelerated this \nquarter, even though interest rates generally remain elevated. We are continuing to invest in the \nWealth Solutions franchise and are adding new relationship managers in key markets, including \nHong Kong, Singapore, UAE and China.  \nSlide 12 \u2013 Conclusion \nSo to summarise, we have had a strong start to the year. Net interest income increased, Wealth \nSolutions and Markets have started the year strongly and the positive momentum in our Banking \nbusiness is helping non-NII. Our loan impairment charge remains low. We have seen growth in RWA \nfrom client opportunities that arose in the first quarter, which in part helps drive Markets income, but \n \nPUBLIC \nwe continue to expect low single-digit growth for the full year. Our capital position and expectations \nof RWA growth are entirely consistent with our goal of returning capital to our shareholders.  \nApril has seen a good start to the quarter, albeit not as strong as the first, consistent with normal \nseasonality as our first quarter always benefits from heightened client activity. More importantly, it is \nconsistent with our group targets for full year 2024.  \nFinally, to bring it all together, as I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining all our forward guidance \nwith one clarification that our income guidance for this year is to deliver growth around the top of the \n5% to 7% range and positive jaws is excluding the impact of the two notable items of the first quarter.  \nWith that, I'll hand back to the operator, and Bill, and I will be happy to take questions.  \nQuestion and Answer session \n<<Operator>> \nAnd now we're going to take our first question. And it comes from the line of Joseph Dickerson from \nJefferies.  \n<<Joseph Dickerson - Head of European Banks Research, Research Division, Jefferies LLC>>  \nCongrats on a very clean and straightforward quarter. I just had one question on costs.","hash":"c22692fffc54bbd61ccc3d82535cbf6b","approximate_tokens_size":492}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"You showed \na lot of financial discipline in the first quarter with 8 points of operating leverage backing out some of \nthe non-recurring revenue. Clearly, you had some pretty strong Financial Markets activity and you \nhaven't seen the Fit for Growth yet really kick in. I'm just wondering how you think about that if markets \nare strong, is there going to be a true-up or an accrual later in the year or anything like that to deflect \nthe very strong start to the year? So any comment on costs over the year.  \nAnd then also just on Wealth, you commented on April, I think, for the group, but I can imagine that \nWealth must also similarly be off to a pretty good start, given the about 10% move in the Hang Seng. \nSo just any thoughts there would be helpful.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nThank you, Joseph. I'll start and then I'll hand it to Bill for some comments towards the end. First, on \nWealth Management versus the group overall, it's broad-based. April has been a good month, \ncompletely consistent with the delivery of the targets in 2024. Bear in mind, of course, it's a \nreinforcement of the sustainability of our Wealth numbers that Wealth results are the accumulation \nof the net-new money and the new to bank that we have quarter-over-quarter and the 62,000 new \nto bank and the $11 billion of net new money that we have recorded during Q1 bode well for the future. \nSo that clearly is the story in Wealth.  \nOn cost discipline, before I hand it over to Bill, a couple of things. Longer term, the guidance remains \nvery clear. It's the $12 billion cost cap, 3% CAGR over the course of the 3 years. We've said from the \nbeginning that it would be more elevated this year and it is the case, and it will continue to be the \ncase. Remember, Fit for Growth doesn't show impacts this year. By the way, neither in terms of the \nsaves and relatively limited in terms of the cost to achieve.","hash":"fea282021a2a2f6e5ba25a1b5abb919f","approximate_tokens_size":468}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"And the last thing that I would say on the \ncost is do bear in mind that the Q2 is usually seasonally higher quarter-on-quarter because it includes \nthe impact of our full March annual pay and bonus round but on the forward.  \n \nPUBLIC \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nGood. Thanks as well, Jo, and thanks for pointing out the discipline, which I agree, discipline in the first \nquarter, but that's also coming off a strong year of financial discipline last year as well, including the \npay round. So we've got a reasonably well-established track record here, and we intend to continue \nthat. So our primary focus is on maintaining and wherever we can, expanding our jaws. We've \nobviously done that very well in the first quarter, and would intend to protect that very important \nspread for the rest of the year as we have and as we'll continue to. Obviously, if we continue to \noutperform, then we would expect to make some true-ups but as always with a view to increasing \nreturns and increasing jaws as we do that.  \nAnd on the overall cost discipline, we have to remind ourselves, we are actually in the third year of our \nlast 3-year program in addition to being in the first year of our next 3-year program. So we had a \nnumber of programs that we've been investing in over the past couple of years that were more \ntactical in nature, less structural than Fit for Growth, which we're completing. So none of us are too \nsurprised that we're coming into this quarter with ongoing good discipline. But we're very excited \nabout the opportunity for the next round of lift off coming from the much more transformational set \nof programs around Fit for Growth. And it is really very different in terms of the way that we're \napproaching it. So as Diego has been very clear, we expect to see some of the expenses kick in this \nyear with some of the benefits kicking in next year and the following year but always following on to \nthe last 3 years\u2019 worth of programs.  \n<<Operator>> \nAnd now we're going to take our next question.","hash":"40a70cb45518419d7df006af89adb4b1","approximate_tokens_size":485}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"And the question comes from the line of Nick Lord \nfrom Morgan Stanley.  \n<<Nicholas Lord \u2013 Head of ASEAN Banks Research, Morgan Stanley>> \nSimilar sort of question really to Joseph's on the CIB side. I just wonder if you could comment a little bit \non both the Flow and the Episodic income and give a bit more detail on what actually drove that. I'd \nbe interested to know if you're still seeing that activity come through, especially in terms of Flow? And \ndo you have a feel both of the pace at which market RWAs might return, might come off? And also \nany comments you have on loan pipeline on the corporate side in the second quarter?  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nThank you, Nick. Clearly good that we have seen a comeback of Episodic this quarter, but let's never \nlose sight of the fact that the vast majority of what we make in Markets is Flow, and therefore good \nto see the 30% increase in episodic, but as good or more good that we've seen the 5% increase in \nFlow. Where Episodic happens because it's event driven, of course, it's difficult to say. This particular \nquarter, GCNA, Africa, Middle East to an extent in a relatively muted volatility picture for the market \noverall, i.e., not the easiest market to navigate. So good there. Flow, by definition, we expect Flow to \ncontinue, Episodic, we'll see a little bit what the future holds for us.  \nRWAs, it's very clear to us. We reiterate very firmly our target of low single-digits growth of RWAs. We \nare nimble. You know this house, for years we have shown our ability to be very aggressive on the \nRWA front. We also flagged at the beginning of the year that we believe that the levels of return on \nrisk-weighted assets that we are achieving, we wanted to use RWA. And I think this is a very good \n \nPUBLIC \nexample. I mean, we've done it. They will come off. They've already started coming off in Q2.","hash":"fa760ef925e4a17079c5551458ee6f2b","approximate_tokens_size":458}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Dependent, of course, on the path of rates, but if anything, over the course of the year, one would \nexpect to see a shift between market risk-weighted assets and credit risk-weighted assets, if anything, \nbut again, dependent on demand for credit.  \nLoans, we pointed out a pipeline, in general, of activity. You will have noticed after our RNS that we \nhave separated our banking business out. We think it's important. We think the drivers of the Banking \nbusiness, of course, are different from the drivers of the Markets business. And we wanted to make \nsure that we gave you the ability to see into it. It's clear that between the Financing Solutions and the \nCapital Markets and Advisory, they are driven by relatively similar things. The pipeline is an important \none. We pointed out we executed on a healthy pipeline. The pipeline remains healthy and actually, if \nanything, healthier than the one that we have executed in Q1, of course, between a pipeline and our \nrealisation comes a market. So we will see where does that get us. Bill?  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nYes, I completely, obviously, agree with everything Diego said. A little bit of colour. I know we \nintroduced this notion of Flow versus Episodic a few years back, and it's an art and not a science to be \nvery precise of what goes into what and what drives each.  Simplistically, we can say that Flow income \nis coming from just the natural flows that come from our clients into our bank. So a lot of that is driven \nby their own cash management or trade financing needs, and we've done quite a good job of \ninternalising that, while providing best execution for customers. That took some doing.  \nAmongst other things, it meant investing heavily in our electronic and digital connectivity not just with \nthe corporate clients who are moving money around but also with investors, including very \nsophisticated investors, which has also meant an establishment of a very robust electronic trading \ncapabilities.","hash":"720232b6d380df28c6af7a408bdd5e8b","approximate_tokens_size":452}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"So the underlying growth in Flow, which has been really good and steady through a \nperiod of time is absolutely influenced on the margin by market volatility, in particular, investors \noveractive in the markets when things are moving around. But the underlying Flow is structurally a \ngrowth story as we take market share as a top 10 and in many markets, a top 3 or top 1, Financial \nMarkets dealer across FX and rates.  \nThe Episodic by its nature is going to be fundamentally different. And the way we think about is it is \nhighly correlated with either market shocks or with a very unusual bursts of client activity or individual \nclient deals. We could sit here and say, in April or May of 2024 that there are going to be no more \nmarket shocks. But it really doesn't feel that way to me. The markets feel extremely prone to sudden \nmovements in various ways, either because of absorption shocks or because we're going through \nsome pretty key inflection points in central bank rate policy and associated currency movement. So \nwe can't call an increase or a decrease or anything else in Episodic flows. I just think the environment \nis pretty conducive to this kind of market events that lead to opportunities for us.  \nIn terms of client-related deals, client volumes are just really, really strong. And to pick up on the third \npoint, of your third question, and Diego answered around loan pipeline, as we said over and over and \nover, we're focusing on returns over income growth. And the loan pipeline is very good. The loan \npipeline was very good in the first quarter. We did not retain many of those loans, most of those loans \nflowed straight through. So we get a 17% increase in Banking income without a big increase in the \nbalance sheet. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. So the fact that our loan growth is a little bit \n \nPUBLIC \nlower than what we guided, and actually, the customer advances was in line, but overall, our real \ngrowth is a little bit lower. It's not a sign of concern. It's accompanied by very strong return on tangible \nequity, which is what we continue to focus on optimising.","hash":"24fa38d7053c65e94bb0791ffdb656c0","approximate_tokens_size":500}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"So when we look at the pipeline, we see a \ngood pipeline, which bodes well for continued growth in Banking income. It may or may not lead to \ngrowth in the balance sheet, but that's okay. I don't want to find that we're solving for the wrong \nproblem. I think Diego answered the RWA question perfectly. So we'll take the next question.  \n<<Operator>> \nAnd the question comes from the line of Andrew Coombs from Citi.  \n<<Andrew Philip Coombs \u2013 Director, Research Division, Citigroup Inc.>>  \nTwo questions, please. Firstly, just on your reiteration of your net interest income guidance. Obviously, \nit's been a sharp move higher in the curve, but you're saying that should be broadly offset by lower \nvolumes, hence, why your guidance is unchanged. I mean if you take your 100 basis points sensitivity \nand $770 million figure you gave previously, which is a parallel shift but to offset that impact would \nimply quite a sizable decline in the volume outlook. So just if you could comment on that, but also if \nthere's anything else in the moving parts there in terms of the NII guidance?  \nAnd then my second question is on the extraordinary items or below the line items. Two parts to this. \nKorea would be the first one. I think in the annual report, you talked about a potential charge of \nseveral hundred million for the equity-linked securities. You've only taken $100 million today. Is that \nbecause the methodology from the regulator was better than you had feared at the time of the \nannual report?  \nAnd also restructuring charges, you flagged this $1.5 billion charge. We haven't seen a material step-\nup in Q1. When do you think we'll see that step-up in restructuring charges coming through?  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nVery good. Thank you, Andrew. Okay, I'll take them from the top. First of all, on NII, let's quickly paint \nthe picture for 2024. So for 24 of the components that we have flagged in terms of the drivers of our \nNII, first of all, the rolling off of the short-term hedge, we clearly have seen only 1 month in this quarter.","hash":"d8c6be8a8fd6ff1b391eb97369eee8d0","approximate_tokens_size":484}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"We're going to see all of the rest of the unfolding of it. On volumes, 2% growth in customer loans and \nadvances, Markets & Banking positive, as Bill was saying before. Of course, Mortgage is a headwind \nin terms of volumes. Also, let's remember that loans and advances are a spot measure, AIEA [Average \nInterest Earning Assets] is an average measure, that's to bear in mind. And so when you think about \nvolume, volume here comes more towards the end of the year. The liabilities mix improved during the \ncourse of the quarter. We [have] run down quite some expensive Corporate Time Deposits and other \nsources of wholesale funding. And so from that point of view, these are really the components for '24.  \nI would point out to your point on IRBB, it behoves me to recommend it given it's in our appendices \nthat we always try to use the currency weighted forward rates that we provide. We think they are \nbetter guide for all the reasons that we went through at the full year results. So I'm not going to go \nthrough them again, but those are the kind of shifts that I think help more predict how we think about \nthe development of NII. At a very high level, because the volatility of rates continues unabated, I would \nsay, if you then extrapolate out to 2025, you have the headwinds that we were expecting for 2025 are \nnow less headwinds. The hedge roll-off continues to be supportive, although to a lower level because \n \nPUBLIC \nit's going to be only $100 million next year. We continue to guide to low single-digit volume growth. \nAnd so if you do your math, you see that anything that you then get in terms of mix effect of assets \nand liabilities, is a little bit on top. That's on the NII.  \nOn the ELS securities, the way that this works is that our Board has approved a voluntary \ncompensation plan for customers. We've taken $100 million provision that reflects the \nimplementation of the voluntary compensation plan based on applying the regulatory guidelines to \nall of the ELS that are outstanding with clients. Now can there be volatility to that number going \nforward?","hash":"a199a5a0d96c8182d133d7f13b444f8a","approximate_tokens_size":492}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Yes, because it is linked to an index, but it gives you a good picture of where we are. Bill, \nanything that you want to add?  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nOnly that this is our best estimate of the total cost of this problem.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nAt this moment. Yes. So that\u2019s it on the ELS. On restructuring, you're right, we don't guide on \nrestructuring. Ten weeks into Fit for Growth, lots of initiatives being prepared. We know what the \nshape more or less is, and we've said it. It's limited cost to achieve this year. The bulk of the cost to \nachieve during the course of next year and then a meaningful chunk in 2026. I think that remains the \nbest guidance that we can give you. I would also be remiss if I did not add the $100 million from the \nprevious program that Bill was referring to that will flow through this year. Thank you, Andrew.  \n<<Operator>> \nAnd the next question comes from the line of Robin Down from HSBC.  \n<<Robin Down \u2013 Managing Director, HSBC>> \nI have a couple of questions. Can I start with the capital position because you're obviously guiding for \nlow single-digit RWA growth, which suggests that from here we are not going to see a great deal of \nRWA growth in the remainder of the year. And obviously, you're going to be generating capital \nthrough the course of this year. Unless we see another buyback in August, aren\u2019t we going to be hitting \na CET1 that's above the 14% top end of the target at year-end. And I know you've got Basel 3.1 next \nyear, and you've got , obviously, the big chunk of restructuring charge to come through, but I'm just \ntrying to think how you're thinking about the capital position and obviously circling back to the kind \nof $5 billion-plus guidance you've given us through the course of the program. It just feels like there's \nupside risk there and perhaps we should be looking for a buyback in August.  \nAnd the second question, just coming back to the revenue guidance for this year.","hash":"da11e98922676a963126e17341a003bc","approximate_tokens_size":486}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Maybe my math is \nwrong, but having had the beat you've had in the first quarter and assuming your interest income \nguidance is right, I think to hit the top end of your range, you just need fee income to be broadly flat \nfor the remainder of the year. And yet you've tailwinds from Wealth Management coming through \nand Q4 is a relatively easy comparator. So I'm just curious as to why you're not increasing the guidance \nfor revenues for this year, whether there's anything in particular that you're worried about or whether \nit's just a degree of caution?  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \n \nPUBLIC \nGood. Thanks very much, Robin, for the question. The approach to capital, as Diego said, as I think \nwe've tried to indicate through time, we're very disciplined in terms of our commitment of capital and \ngrowth in underlying RWAs. And we demonstrated that we've got lots of levers that we can pull if, \nand as when we need to, that's number one. Number two, we are very, very comfortable operating \nwithin the full range of our guided CET1, so between 13% and 14%. So 13.6% especially given the \nearnings and capital generation momentum, we're comfortably in the top half of that range right \nnow. And we're perfectly comfortable going to the lower part of the range, we'll always consider at \nthe time what the internal uses of capital are and what the external environment is. But in previous \nperiods, we've been comfortable going down to the lower part of that range.  \nThird is we are fully aware of the attractiveness of buying back our shares even at today's slightly \nhigher price than the last time it was described as a version of fertiliser. And so recognising the value \nthat shareholders attach to returns of capital, we'll be very, very disciplined to manage our internal \ncapital allocation and to return surplus capital to shareholders if, as and when we're able to do that. \nAnd I maybe just underscore that we've got plenty of levers to pull to make sure that we remain \ndisciplined and consistent in terms of the way that we're generating RWAs. I\u2019ll hand over to Diego for \nthe revenue point.","hash":"c34532fc5d50efd0ca775d1294c73ebe","approximate_tokens_size":493}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"And anything else you want to say on capital.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nI couldn't add anything to that. On revenues, Robin, you've given yourself your answer. Yes, we are \nvery pleased. We are very encouraged. It's a strong start it further increases our confidence in the full \nyear outcome, but it is the first quarter. And so we'll see what the world holds in store for us. I concur \nwith one of the things that you said, which is that through the resilience of our two engines of non-NII \nis very visible. I continue to stress how that 5% increase in Flow at a time when the market was not the \nperfect market, it clearly shows that to be able to trade certain pockets with our clients, to assist them, \nto assist our multinational corporations at different times in different places is clearly a good thing. \nAnd in Wealth Management, the strength of the leading indicators is also completely consistent with \ndelivering a good year in Wealth Management. So yes, there's nothing that we are worried about, but \nit's the first quarter.  \n<<Operator>> \nAnd the next question comes from the line of Perlie Mong from KBW.  \n<<Perlie Mong - Research Division, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Limited>> \nJust picking up on some of the discussion that we just had. I just wanted to ask about a higher-for-\nlonger environment. Part of the increase in Episodic flows probably reflects lower rate expectations in \nQ1, you might disagree but for me, a big change in Q1 versus Q4 was with the rate expectations, \nespecially U.S. rates coming down. So first of all, do you agree with that? And secondly, while given \nthat expectation has now changed in recent weeks, does that change your outlook in any way? So \nthat's the first question.  \nAnd the second question is on Market income, so in one of your slides, you mentioned that Episodic \nflows is 30% higher as you deploy more market RWAs to help clients take advantage of opportunities. \nBut you also mentioned that you expect market RWAs to come down. Does that mean Episodic \ngrowth is expected to come down as well?","hash":"d0266dec3babaac0f60a9ac848cafd6d","approximate_tokens_size":486}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"And then, just very quickly picking up on the comment, you \n \nPUBLIC \ntalked about credit risk migration that from here, if anything, going to be less market risk and more \ncredit risk. Just what do you mean by that? Because, if I look at the Stage 3 delinquencies, it looks \npretty benign this quarter.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nVery good. I'll take it and then Bill can add. I'll actually start from the bottom. What I meant, and I'm \nsorry if I didn't communicate properly, I didn't mean that there was a change in credit. I meant that \nover the course of the year, if you believe that there's going to be demand for credit, the shape of our \nrisk-weighted assets ought to move towards credit risk-weighted assets rather than just market risk-\nweighted assets. We don't see that credit risk-weighted assets today, but we hope to see more of \nthem. No issue from the point of view of credit. If anything, I would flag that the impact of credit \nmigration within our risk-weighted assets is like very low single-digit hundreds of millions of dollars in \nRWA. So no credit migration effect in our risk-weighted assets. So that's on that part.  \nOn the other, I would zoom out for a second from simply looking at the impact of expectations on \nhigher rates or on lower rates. Again, I don't want to repeat the same thing, but again, going to the \npoint of Flow and Episodic, there is a lot of the flow that when things change in the world, it's why our \nclients rebalance their liabilities, their hedges, their supply chain dynamics in terms of accounts \npayable, receivable, et cetera. All of that flows through us, and therefore, I would caution not to try to \ntie, neither Flow nor Episodic, to a simple specific indicator whether it is rates, by the way, whether it's \nthe volatility of rates, whether it is the volatility of currencies, whether it's dollar strength versus dollar \nweakness. On such a broad franchise like ours, a lot of these effects diversify themselves. Within them, \nthere are spikes, and those spikes will change, as we said. This quarter, we flagged some.","hash":"132a1e176dc538585ed94adde79a676d","approximate_tokens_size":493}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"There might \nbe others driving the other.  \nTo the second part of your question on market risk-weighted assets, an important point, and thank \nyou for raising it. We have increased market revenues over many previous quarters while substantially \nshrinking market risk-weighted assets. The link between market risk-weighted assets and Markets \nincome is not univocal. At times, there is a link, but it's difficult to drive a direct link so much so that we \nare very comfortable with what we are doing, which is currently reducing the market risk-weighted \nassets. And we don't think that that ought to be seen as a sign that we think that there's going to be \nless market revenues. But Bill, do you want to...  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nI think that's perfect. I think just to underscore what I think Diego just very clear about, there's no \ncorrelation between the growth in Episodic and anything really related to the inflection point in \ninterest rates expectations. Diego, hopefully and extraordinarily transparently called out Africa and \nChina as two drivers of the increase in Episodic. And of course, everything is related to interest rates \nsomehow. Currencies are driven by interest rates ultimately and currency has clearly moved. But you \nknow some of what's going on in the world, and these are not primarily interest rate-driven events, \nthey're market-driven events, where the fact that we've got a very, very strong local franchise across \na large number of African markets and a very strong local franchise, not just in China, but between \nChina and all of China's major trading partners, puts us in an extraordinary position to take \nadvantage of these either market flows or dis-locations as they come up.  \n \nPUBLIC \nAnd I won't say we're unique in every regard, but I will say that the nature of our market footprint is \nunique, and that puts us in a position where we have many opportunities to \u2018score a goal\u2019 as it were \nalways by helping clients. And that's, I think, a key differentiator of our business. You'll note that from \ntime to time, it's a challenge as well.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"But we remember that episode from the last three years, and we \nremember that our bank did extraordinarily well through that period as well. So while there's always \nsome downside risk with the upside opportunities, I'm going to give us pretty high marks for having \nmanaged the risk and capitalised on the opportunities.  \n<<Operator>> \nAnd the next question comes from the line of Kun Peng Ma from China Securities.  \n<<Kun Peng Ma \u2013 Managing Director, Head of Financials Research, China Securities>> \nThis is Kun Peng of China Securities. I've got two questions for you. The first is a follow-up on the \nrevenue guidance. I'm wondering whether we can expect a better year for next year? Because I \nnoticed you even cut your expectation for the rate cuts for next year even more than this year. Sorry \nfor speaking on with this question, but it's quite important. The second is on the trading corridor \nbusiness and the Transaction Banking. Would you please provide us with more updates and outlook \nfor the Transaction Banking business and its volume, pricing, et cetera?  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nThank you, Kun Peng. So revenue guidance for next year, we've given you our targets. We said [we \nwould] continue to increase our return on tangible equity over the course of the years. Although we \nhave not put out direct guidance on NII, we have said that we expect higher NII next year compared \nto this year. So all of that doesn't change. You are right. All other things being equal, higher rates for \nnow are, either you can say a tailwind or a rather reduction of a headwind. And next year, our currency \nforward rates imply a better position compared to what we saw at the beginning of this year. But \nagain, it's early in time, and we see what exactly materialised. From that point of view, I would refer \nyou again to what we said last quarter about different engines of growth at different times in the \ncycle in terms of having a strong and differentiated set of products. Bill?  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nJust to add a little bit of colour.","hash":"d13f9e1579a23a53b2c56e54078c62e0","approximate_tokens_size":489}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"The reason we're perfectly happy with this higher for longer scenario, \nbut not overexuberant, is that there's a downside to higher rates. And obviously, there's an NII upside, \nand we've called that out quite clearly. But we would expect there to be on the margin, some credit \nstresses, which is part of the reason that we're guiding to a return to our average credit loss through \nthe cycle. We're still operating well below our average right now. We don't see any problems in the \nportfolio, right. Just to be perfectly clear, it's not a forecast of issues or early warning on problems. If \nwe have a higher for longer rate environment, you would expect at some point to see that flow \nthrough to credit losses. And at some point, you would expect to see that flow through to capital \nmarket volumes. So net-net, it's pretty clear that it's a positive for us. If you put it into the tailwind \ncategory, it's not without consideration for some of the downside risks, especially when you get out \ninto 2025.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \n \nPUBLIC \nThank you, Bill. And with that on Trade and the trade corridors. So a few things. In terms of trade \ncorridors, some of the strength that we have seen in previous quarters continued, trade corridors \ntowards ASEAN and towards the Middle East remain very, very strong, whether it's from Singapore, \nfrom Korea, from other sources. China outbound has remained healthy and particularly healthy going \ntowards Europe. So that is to give you some broad colour about the corridors. In terms of Trade and \nTransaction Banking, volumes were down last year. We have continued to work on our products, \ninvest in our products, invest in our relationship managers. We have data that's confirmed to us that \nwe have maintained our market share. And if you believe forecasts that Trade volumes are expected \nto grow in the low single digits this year, from many different multinational sources, that ought to be \ngood for someone who naturally sits astride the trade routes of the world.  \n<<Operator>> \nAnd the next question comes from the line of Aman Rakkar from Barclays.","hash":"0a7ed04f44ab2bbe791475a157e4e1e6","approximate_tokens_size":485}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"<<Amandeep Singh Rakkar - European Banks Analyst, Barclays Bank PLC>>  \nI just had a question on NII, actually more NIM, if I may. And I think just based on current run rates and \nthe benefit of the tactical hedge into the next quarter, I know rates are less of a drag this year, but my \nback of the envelope suggests that we do need a bit of volume growth this year to get to the target \nrange. And I do note that at full year you broke out that your volume and mix was a big component \nof actually getting to the 2024 NII. But for volumes it looks like it's maybe more subdued than what we \nthought before. I'm just trying to think about if loan growth or average interest earning asset growth \ndoesn't meaningfully kick on from here and if it's kind of flattish through year-end, what's the NIM self-\nhelp that you have at your disposal? So can you help us think about what you've left to do on assets \nand liability mix that can actually lift the NIM? Is it realistic to think you \u2013can lift the NIM in the absence \nof loan growth is essentially what I'm asking.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nOkay, Aman, absolutely. So look, first of all, we don't guide on NIM anymore, and that's why we went \nto NII. We think it's simpler, but you're right. The way to think of it is we do bake into our NII walks the \npresence of volume growth. I would point out that on an underlying basis, our volume grew by 2% or \n$4 billion in this quarter, which was not an easy quarter to grow volumes. So to give up or to throw the \nsponge, as we say, on the volume growth this early is a bit early. We have many quarters to play for. \nSo let's not discount the fact that there are some green shoots for volume.  \nHaving said that, NIM is also very much a mixed story.","hash":"cae7b8e3930f6af8a86711cb6c0b5aaf","approximate_tokens_size":457}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"In this particular quarter, it's very clear that our NIM was very much helped by what we've done in \nTreasury in terms of running off expensive CTDs, other sources of more expensive wholesale funding. \nAnd so if you wish on the self-help side, particularly in a bank that by our nature of being on a large \ngeographic footprint with  very many different markets, et cetera, and therefore, with a more active \ntreasury function, we have a number of levers that we can pull from that point of view. And of course, \nyou pointed out yourself, there is the mathematical, mechanical impact of the short-term hedge still \ncoming to our help. I would say that, that is the key. Too early to give up on volumes. Bill, is there \nanything...?  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \n \nPUBLIC \nYes, I mean Aman, I love your request for guidance on self-help. I mean the best self-help for us is to \ngrow our non-NII by 25%. That's not guidance, but that's what we did in the first quarter. And the \nmomentum is really good. So yes, of course, we should focus on NII. At current run rate, it's a little bit \nover half of our income, but only a little over half of our income and the other half is growing much \nfaster and is generating higher returns. So our self-help is very focused on generating the volume \ngrowth that we think is consistent with our business so that we can grow NII and accrete returns at \nthe same time, but the real self-help is coming by driving that non NII growth, leveraging the balance \nsheet that we're using to generate non NII. So not to be too cheeky with the answer, but sometimes I \nthink it's important to focus on the real earnings drivers of the group, which are less NII and more non \nNII even though sometimes we focus more analytically on the NII line.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nThank you, Bill. Thank you, Aman. Sorry, Aman go ahead. One more. Please reconnect.  \n<<Amandeep Singh Rakkar - European Banks Analyst, Barclays Bank PLC>>  \nJust one point of clarification.","hash":"5df80c8790e9148c2922bea6db56f437","approximate_tokens_size":485}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"So say, if you're sticking with the low single-digit loan growth \nexpectation for this year, given your efforts on treasury assets, and also the fact that the loan growth \nmight be a bit more back-end loaded this year, does that necessarily translate into low single-digit \naverage interest earning asset growth this year? Or should we expect that to be lower?  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nA bit difficult to say in the sense that there are a few other moving pieces in that. But over the course \nof the year, I would really focus on the underlying dynamics because the noise that you introduce \nwhen you look at other things, I think, distracts you a little bit. So I find it difficult to give you a guidance \nthat takes the average interest-earning assets into consideration. Sorry, there was a second part?  \n<<Amandeep Singh Rakkar - European Banks Analyst, Barclays Bank PLC>>  \nNo, that's it.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nThat was it. Okay. Thank you, Aman. Sorry, operator, so once more, please.  \n<<Operator>> \nNow we're going to take our last question for today. And it comes from the line of Gurpreet Sahi from \nGoldman Sachs.  \n<<Gurpreet Singh Sahi - Financial analyst, Goldman Sachs>> \nCongrats on a very strong set of numbers, Bill and Diego. I have two questions. First, on focusing on \nthe strong aspect, which is Banking. So trying to understand this a bit better why this was so strong \nthis quarter, up 17%? So what was there in the quarter that led to increased demand from our clients \nor other banks to get this distributed loan from our side where we originated and distributed? So what \nchanged in the environment? So that we can in future model such things going forward. So that's on \nBanking.  \n \nPUBLIC \nSecond, on NII. Can you help us think whether the deposit betas have peaked, and what we are seeing \nin terms of CASA? Some back of the envelope calculations based on what you disclose on slide 18 \nseem to suggest that the CASA rate, overall blended CASA ratio just moved down in the quarter. So \nseems like the migration has not peaked. So what are we seeing?","hash":"35d9a381e0ac09087401f45f8b75cc42","approximate_tokens_size":500}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Any colour would be greatly \nappreciated.  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nSo why don\u2019t I take a stab at the Banking question and then hand over to Diego on the NII. So the \nenvironment was supportive for us in Banking. We had a good financing pipeline coming into the \nquarter. The market environment was conducive to execution, both in high grade and high yield \nacross our markets. On Sustainable Finance, the pace of growth has slightly slowed. I would say it was \na slightly difficult beginning of the year, Sustainable Finance has been one of our biggest drivers of \ngrowth, but still substantial growth in the first quarter, contributing meaningfully to that 17% overall. \nAnd as I mentioned before, and Diego has mentioned several times, we've increased the velocity of \nour balance sheet.  \nSo the proportion of the deal pipeline that we ended up retaining on our balance sheet was relatively \nlow. And the proportion that we were able to take some fees through a continued build-up of our \ndistribution capabilities was very strong. The pipeline remains strong. The environment remains \nsupportive. And we know that's somewhat sentiment driven. I should note as well that this Banking \nline will be seasonal as are many other things in our bank, people come out of the blocks, especially \nin a year where the economic environment is looking pretty good, they come out in the early part of \nthe year, trying to get ahead of their financing plans. So we can't forecast 17% growth consistently. \nBut we had a good pipeline, we have a good pipeline, we executed well on it, and we did it in a very \nreturns-accretive way.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nOn your second question, Gurpreet, I would say that CASA-TD [ratio] is broadly where we expected it \nto be. The reason, if anything, that you see a slightly lower CASA has to do with some of the dynamics \nin terms of net new money coming in, in the Wealth business because as we flagged out to you, \nalthough the vast majority of the net new money in Wealth now comes in as Wealth products, a \nportion still comes in as deposits.","hash":"613576b38e551649a80cf0078cb546e0","approximate_tokens_size":494}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"At this time in the cycle, those deposits are fundamentally time \ndeposits. So you see the impact is not so much the fact that our existing clients move CASA to time \ndeposits at this time in the cycle, but it's more the fact that the money that comes in is very heavily \nskewed towards time deposits. So with that, Bill.  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nGood. Thanks very much, everybody, for taking the time. I know it's a very busy day and a busy week. \nI really appreciate the questions. And of course, always available to get back on details if you want to \nget in touch with me and Diego or IR directly. Thanks.

The result is \na cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more \nclient-centric. We\u2019re already seeing faster decision making and a nimbler organization at work.  We have \nclear lines of accountability, starting with my management team, fewer layers, increased spans of control, \nand frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity.   \n \nThis will all help us run the company more efficiently, it will enhance our clients\u2019  experience, and improve our agility and ability to execute.   And while reducing expenses wasn\u2019t the primary driver of the program, \nmore roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 we discussed in January.  \n \nWe also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right placing businesses to better capture synergies; exiting certain businesses in Markets that just didn\u2019t fit with our \nstrategy; and right sizing the workforce in Wealth.  \n \nAs a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately \n7,000 positions which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run-rate expense saves.  The combination of \nthese actions and the measures we are taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 to \n$2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run-rate saves in the medium term.   \n \nWe are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard \nour commitment to the Transformation.","hash":"3795f2857ae7bb52f1160c80e3a2ecf5","approximate_tokens_size":476}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the Transformation \nis a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades.   \n \nWe have made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, \nand strengthen our risk and control environment.  All of which are necessary, not only to meet the \nexpectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively.   \n \nA transformation of this magnitude is never linear. So while we have made good progress in many areas, \nthere are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and \nthe data related to regulatory reporting.  We are committed to getting these right and will look to self-fund \nthe necessary investments to do so. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTurning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year.  We reported net income of approximately $3.4 \nbillion, EPS of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% \nyear-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the billion-dollar gain from the India consumer \nsale last year.  Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special \nassessments. \n \nServices continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter \nas both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients.  \n \nFees were up a pleasing 10% for Services year over year, driven by the investments we have made across \nour product offering, platforms and client experience.  In Securities Services, we took share again this \nquarter.  And in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth, and commercial card \nspend remained robust.  We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our Investor \nPresentation on Services in June. \n Markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in \u201923.  While revenues were down 7% as lower volatility \nimpacted Rates and Currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year.  We saw good client activity \nin Equities and in Spread Products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly \nrobust.  We fully integrated our Financing and Securitization capabilities within our Markets business and \nwe started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients.","hash":"715fad264ac56b98925cc8f6c8610914","approximate_tokens_size":498}

While M&A revenues are still low across the street, I was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter, such as Diamondback\u2019s merger with Endeavor Energy and Catalent\u2019s merger with Nova Holdings.  \n \n \nWe are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second \nquarter in light of improved market valuations.

Total revenues \nwere down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion \ngain from the sale of the India consumer business in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3%, driven \nby growth across Banking, USPB and Services, partially offset by declines in Markets and Wealth. Expenses \nwere $14.2 billion, up 7%, on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental \nFDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily \ndriven by higher Card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in Wealth, Banking and \nLegacy Franchises.  At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-\nfunded loans ratio of approximately 2.8%. \nOn slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, \nwhich included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million.  Also included in this \nnumber are $225 million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we\u2019ve incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters.

{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"On slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I\u2019ll speak to \nsequential variances. In the \nfirst quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4 \nbasis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat.  \nAverage loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card \nand Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services.  And average deposits \nwere up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by Services, as we continue to grow high-quality operating \ndeposits. \nOn slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter, we adjusted our FICO \ndistribution to be more aligned with industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 \nthreshold.  Across Branded Cards and Retail Services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers \nwith FICO scores of 660 or higher.  And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% \nfor our total card portfolio.  In our Corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, \nwhich is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our \nloan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which \nincludes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the \nnearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment. Turning to slide 10, I\u2019d like to take a moment to \nhighlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and \nliquidity.

Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter, we \nimplemented a revenue sharing arrangement within Banking, and between Banking, Services and Markets \nto reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing \nis included in the \u201cAll other\u201d line for each business in our Financial Supplement.  In Services, revenues were \nup 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services.  Net interest \nincome increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%, \nlargely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased \n9%, USD clearing volumes increased 3% and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was \ndriven by strong corporate client activity.  In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and \nadministration increased 11%, benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding.  \nThe growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investments in product innovation, the \nclient experience and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments.  TTS continues to \nmaintain its number one position with Large Corporate and FI clients and see good momentum in the \ncommercial client segment. And we continue to gain share in Securities Services.  Expenses increased 11%, \nlargely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation.  Cost of credit was $64 \nmillion as net credit losses remain low.  Net income was approximately $1.5 billion.  Average loans were up \n4%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as \nthe impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing \nclients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow.  And Services \ncontinues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter. \nOn slide 13, we show the results for Markets for the first quarter.","hash":"b3c1e27690cac5f69a4f70f5ffa043d4","approximate_tokens_size":488}

Fixed Income revenues decreased 10%, driven \nby Rates and Currencies, which were down 21%, on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the \nprior year. This was partially offset by strength in Spread Products and Other Fixed Income, which was up \n26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continued to see \ngood underlying momentum in Equities, with revenues up 5%, driven by growth across cash trading and \nequity derivatives. And we continued to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses \nincreased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year.  Cost of credit was $200 \nmillion, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans in Spread Products that impacted \nreserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion.

{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"So that's very concrete, but more generally, after 20, \n30, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're \ntalking about them differently, but the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting \nthese lines of business differently, or are you actually running them differently? Thanks. \n \nJANE FRASER: Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what \nwe said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have but \nhow we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank. It's eliminated \nneedless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you \ncan see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, \nbut also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. \n \nSo maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and \nthat eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run \nend-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's \nenabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the \nbottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera. \n \nWe also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the \nInvestment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting F&S \nand Securitization into Markets, so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the \nbenefits of that this quarter. \n \nSo that's an example in the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change. \nT R A N S C R I P T \nCiti First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call \nApril 12, 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Citigroup Inc.","hash":"ff94b628b43ecff3576435b53ee4116c","approximate_tokens_size":464}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"8 \n \nSo, by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in \nthe geographies, that's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal \nentity management, and we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large \nnumber of committees in the geographies, and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles \nwere streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, \nlighter clusters, and that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, \netcetera we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler. \n \nThe third piece, we created the client organization. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities \nand disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a \nlot easier, it took up a lot of time, and we've given much clearer mandates and we've more than halved the \nnumber of committees. That's 200 committees-plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by \nconsolidating them or eliminating them. \n \nThe spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, \nmuch faster decision-making, it's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very \nquickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities. We've eliminated \nmost co-heads. We've reduced matrix reporting. We've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So \nall of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in \nthose five businesses and the Transformation.  \n \nIt already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much \neasier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding \ncompany.

And, yes, it \nwas a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a \nmix of both revenue and underlying business strength. \n \nAs you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-Markets being \ndown modestly.

{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"And I think this quarter is a good example of where and how that's likely \nto play through, so the revenue top line being up 3-plus percent, but when you look through each of the \nbusinesses, and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue, you can see the underlying \nNIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages, that's coming through as well. So Services \nup 14% with growth in both TTS, between cross-border, clearing, commercial cards, but also \u2013  and Securities \nServices, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We \nexpect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our \ncommercial market \u2013  commercial middle market business, excuse me.

It includes looking \nat the productivity of existing bankers and advisors, and those kind of reductions will start to play out in the \nsubsequent quarters. \n \nI do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so, you can see on some of \nthe metrics on page 15 in the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight \nthat because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to \ncontinue to invest and replenish low-performing or low-producing bankers and advisors with resources that \nactually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of \nus. \n \nSo, long-winded way of saying there's some operating efficiency upside for us for sure. It's a combination of \nthe top line and the expense work playing through the balance of the quarters and the year here. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \n \nJIM MITCHELL: Okay. Good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth \nopportunities and driving growth. But revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your \ncontrol. So, can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses? You have a range in 2026 of $51 \nbillion to $53 billion.","hash":"c8831295fc8322c60790f316c3ca6aa6","approximate_tokens_size":473}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"So, if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, A, fair to assume you'd be \nat the very low-end of that range or is \u2013  and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So, is there \nsome flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks. \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah. Look, the top line growth, as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We've put \nthat target out there of $51 billion to $53 billion as a range of what we're working towards. We've given you a \ngood sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already \nsignaled $1.5 billion that's in front of us. \n \nThe reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range, obviously, the volume-related \nexpenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue \nis softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those \nare appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top line. \n \nWith that said, we've got to continue to invest in the Transformation. We're not going to compromise that. \nThat's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of \nhow the dynamic works. There's a top \u2013  we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated \nresiliency around if you think about the past couple of years, and we expect for those to continue to drive \nsome top line momentum. But we've got levers in case they don't. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go \nahead. \n \nEBRAHIM POONAWALA: Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark, around capital. So, you talked about \n$13 billion over the reg minimum. Like you could easily be doing 2x the buyback you did in one quarter, if not \nmore.

Thank you. \n \nMARK MASON: Sure. Look, you know and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly, given where we \ntrade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes \nT R A N S C R I P T \nCiti First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call \nApril 12, 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Citigroup Inc.  \n \n12 \n \nsense in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about 13.5% this quarter. That does give us \ncapacity above the 13.3%. But it's important to keep in mind that there's client demand that will continue to \nevolve. We want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be \nin Markets or other parts of the franchise. \n \nAnd then, there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is we \nare hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III Endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't \nhappened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so, we want to see how that continues to play out. \nWe're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves, and we'll continue to take \nthe buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But we recognize that there's an opportunity there, and \nwe'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Please unmute your line and ask your question. \n \nERIKA NAJARIAN: Hi. Good afternoon. So, clearly, the theme of this that's emerging on the Q&A is a healthy \nskepticism about the revenue targets in line with the \u2013  in light of the expense declines, which is not really us \nanalysts, we're sort of a little bit parroting what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet \njumped into the stock.","hash":"f5789884f1382938d2c5f7f0fdfb228d","approximate_tokens_size":473}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"So, to that end, I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently, and then ask \na question about card late fees. \n \nHow are you balancing \u2013  clearly, your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 \nmillion. But growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR would mean potentially some capital plowed back into \nthe business. I guess how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at \nCiti than any other money center peer? And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that \nwould impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation than October? \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah. Thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I'd just remind you and everyone \nelse that we're playing for the long-term here, right. So, we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, \nJane has recasted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that, but we're \nplaying for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise. \n \nIt's why I've given you a range around the expenses, at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the \nimportance of protecting the Transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why I started the answer \nto Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, \nwhere the returns to do so makes sense. And so, we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other \nresources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good \nreturns against the idea of returning that to shareholders. \n \nAnd so, we'll continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. \nFrankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the \nclients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the \nplatform.","hash":"641f26bafa7ab4b858c64307a4b306eb","approximate_tokens_size":473}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"And so, that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in \naddition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in. \n \nIn terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount \nof the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And \nthe only thing I'd add to that is it did kind of \u2013  it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed. \nBut again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top line revenue for the year. \n \nJANE FRASER: I\u2019d also, just a\ns a reminder, 85% of our two card portfolios are prime, and in CRS, where you \ntend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that \u2013  the economics of the fee change will be \nshared with our partners in CRS.

But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be \nputting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement. \n \nMARK MASON: Good add, thank you. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go \nahead. \n \nJOHN MCDONALD: Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the \ncredit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on Retail \nServices. Do you still feel like you'll see a peak this year? And what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms \nof delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs \nthis year? \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah. Thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. \nWe've seen continued top line growth. We've seen continued average interest-earning balance growth.","hash":"4ae850eeba2346494c61271393cc3aba","approximate_tokens_size":498}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"We've \ntalked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The \nrange that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the \nportfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so, \nwe're watching the lower income customer profile \u2013\n or customers that we have. But again, as Jane \nmentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with. \n \nWhere we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the \ncurrent NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is \nnot inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters \nare higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses \ntend to mature or materialize through that process. \n \nAnd so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming \ndown. And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off \nof these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it, and the factors that are out there that \nare important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest \nrates, and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time. \n \nI think the final point I'd make and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that \nthe loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, \nand this is an industry dynamic, through the COVID pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, \npayment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus.","hash":"3706a2afb98fe1ba994ac38d25af42a0","approximate_tokens_size":456}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature, albeit at a lagged pace from what \nwould be normal, and we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done start to mature at their \nnormal pace. And so, these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and that's an important factor we can't \nlose sight of. But the bottom line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the \nquality mix that we have, and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here. \n \nJOHN MCDONALD: Okay and on the Branded side, you still expect kind of the peak-ish? Are you still inside \nof the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the Branded charge-offs? \n \nMARK MASON: Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in \nBranded. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies.

Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little \nbit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments \nyou just made and seasonal softer loan growth So, just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think, \ncontinue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit? \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah, sure. Look, I think that when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same \nfactors that come into play. So, obviously, the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think \nabout some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumptions \nweighted is about 5%, the downside is about 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so, how that evolves \nwill be an important factor.","hash":"4a9790ffdbff59b5724429ea2f9ee193","approximate_tokens_size":470}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"How HPI evolves would be an important consideration here for this portfolio, but \nalso what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they \nincrease or decrease. \n \nAnd then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from \ntransactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have \nto continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest \nrates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of \nthose things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the \nreserves. \n \nBut I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve \nlevels. The 8.2% for combined kind of ACL-to-loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio and we'll \ncontinue to watch it. \n \nKEN USDIN: Okay. And a separate question on TTS. That NII related to TTS has been remarkable with rising \nrates. This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter \nthat it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the TTS NII, and \nwhat are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward? Thanks. \n \nMARK MASON: Sure, yeah. I mean, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have kind of some Argentina playing \nthrough the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And \nwe have seen, this is the corporate client, it is an institutional client. We have seen betas, particularly in the \nUS, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the \nUS continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base. \n \nBut all of that again is inside of the range that we've talked about.","hash":"2d1fb06c193e78fad5d18afde4d53355","approximate_tokens_size":488}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year \ngrowth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of \nkind of how the rate environment\u2019 s evolved, and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on \ndeposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the \noperating deposits, and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \n \nVIVEK JUNEJA: Hi. Thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina, you've shown $100 million in \nNII. Total net income benefit of $500 million after-tax, so probably implying about $500 million, $600 \nmillion of non-interest income benefit. Which line item \u2013  sorry, which segment did that come through, and \nis that sustainable? \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax \nimpact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that \nif you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client \nT R A N S C R I P T \nCiti First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call \nApril 12, 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Citigroup Inc.  \n \n15 \n \nrelationships. And the primary activities include some of the TTS-type of activities that we've talked about, \nso liquidity management, payments, custody within the Services business. And so, you'd see a good portion \nof the activity in Argentina playing through the Services business, some of it in Markets as well, but again, \nthe majority of the activity in Services. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \n \nSCOTT SIEFERS: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a \ncomponent of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning.","hash":"bc3b652fbece5e3315da9a830648a278","approximate_tokens_size":474}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"I guess \nI only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we \npotentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your \nmanagement or make you feel better or worse about the overall NII momentum for the company? \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate \nimplieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect \nfor our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 \nbillion. \n \nAnd in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded, \nas well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate \nreduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas \ncontinue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees \nare actually booked in our NII line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly \nbe puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the \nguidance where it is. \n \nTo answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we \nhave that's out. And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 \nbasis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, \nfor Citi, US dollar and non-US dollar, that we're asset-sensitive. So, as rates increase, we should see an \nincrease in our NII performance. \n \nBut if you look at the breakdown and that's about \u2013  I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of \nthe impact of that move.","hash":"dd859c22512ac4b45c0f7287c4edf654","approximate_tokens_size":496}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for US dollar, \nat this point we're neutral. So, if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates \nto our revenue. \n \nFor the non-US dollar, we're still quite asset-sensitive, right? And so, that should give you some sense for \u2013  \nand we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve to a static \nbalance sheet, etcetera, but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as \nit relates to our book of business. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go \nahead. \n \nGERARD CASSIDY: Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane. Mark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of \nconversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the \ncorporate side, which obviously is very strong, we have seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield \ncorporate debt, leverage debt, etcetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do \nyou think the spreads would be widening? Can you guys share with us what you're seeing on the corporate \nside in terms of competition?

And what I'd say is that we've \nbeen very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in \nterms of the investment-grade large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an \nunderwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit, and that I think will \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nI think importantly, as we think about our Corporate Lending activity, you'll note that actually we've been \nvery disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet.","hash":"813acce1e0f429694116b35b5938a596","approximate_tokens_size":498}
{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"And part of that again is a by-product of the \nrevenue sharing that we've implemented, where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the \nnames that we want to continue to serve, and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader \nplatform that we have. \n \nAnd so, I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite \ncontinued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go \nand continue to evolve. And I think we're well-positioned to be thoughtful about that, but Jane, you may \nwant to add a couple points to it. \n \nJANE FRASER: Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our Commercial Banking mid-\nmarket client base have very healthy balance sheets and we're also seeing market access gradually opening \nup as well, which is also helpful for \u2013  to the quality issuers across all asset classes. We're seeing both the \nissuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well over-subscribed. So, that's also been \nbeneficial as corporates think about their financing needs. \n \nThe other piece I\u2019d\n just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries \nis a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and boards and active discussions are increasing, as supportive \ncapital markets create confidence, as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed \nacquisition finance, bridge financing and some of the higher-margin capital markets and lending activity as \nwell. \n \nSo, as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing, \nrefinancing, looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters. But I'd just close by \nsaying I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility.

Previously, you had talked about \n\"bending the cost curve\" between the third and the fourth quarter of this year, and on this call I thought I \nheard you say it's basically bent, that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower \nfrom here, so did it just happen six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this \nyear? \n \nMARK MASON: I'll take it.

The macro scenario, Fed assumptions look quite similar to last \nyear but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions, which admittedly \ndepressed earnings last year, want to get a sense as to whether there are any idio-factors that could result \nin greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on longer-term trajectory for the SCB, \njust given the org simplification efforts that are underway. \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah, Steven the first part of your question is just impossible to answer to be candid with \nyou, right.

{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the \nregulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what \nhappens with the stress capital buffer, and we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like and so \nreally hard to call at this stage. \n \nThe second part of your question I think is spot-on and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that \nwe have the medium-term targets that we've set and we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our \nstrategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, \npredictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously \nplays through an expense base that'll be lower when we get to that medium-term period. \n \nSo all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB \nscore and the like and the freeing up of capital which we've already freed up $6 billion or so, and so all of \nthose things have kind of yet to have been factored in and we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the \nmedium-term. \n \nOPERATOR: Our next question is from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo.

The confidence comes from the \nfocus that we've had with our existing clients as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more \nwith existing in more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle-market space, and so we've \nbeen very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also, provide the most \nstickiness as it relates to that relationship and so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the \nway of underlying operating deposit growth including inside this quarter.","hash":"9b6ee90ee171f0a5b70aaa660266f6fe","approximate_tokens_size":490}

And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some \nrestructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q \nto hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here? Thanks. \n \nMARK MASON: Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point \nout that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it, and so when you \nback that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you \nthe same \u2013  I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the \nend of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity \naround repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy.

{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Edited transcript of DBS first-quarter 2024 conference call for buy and sell sides, 2 May 2024 \nNicholas Teh  \nGood morning and welcome to the analyst briefing. We can go straight to \nQ&A.  \nTan Yong Hong (Citi) \nI have two questions. The first one is on loans. The non-trade \ncorporate loan growth was great. Is it too early to take it as a sign that borrowers have accepted \nhigher rates, which would mean upside to our the low-single-digit full-year outlook?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nI think it is too early to say so. Our pipelines for the second quarter are solid, \nbut nowhere near as strong as the first quarter. So, at this point in time, we are not changing our full-\nyear guidance. If interest rates continue to stay high, it would also mean some headwinds for the \nHong Kong book as well.  \nTan Yong Hong \nMy second question is on your guidance of 6-7% for income growth and low-\n40% for the cost-income ratio. They seem to imply some slowdown in your top line and a pick-up in \nexpenses in the coming quarters.  \nPiyush Gupta  \nThe projected slowdown in the top line is due to uncertainty. Also, our first-\nquarter income tends to be stronger and the fourth quarter weaker because of seasonality. It would \nbe unrealistic to multiply the first-quarter income by four. In terms of expenses, we are keeping full-\nyear expense growth of high-single-digit. When you look at the income and expense projections, \nyou wind up with the cost-income ratio in the very low-40% area. \nTan Yong Hong \nCould the slowdown in income potentially come from non-interest income, for \nexample wealth management and treasury customer sales? \nPiyush Gupta  \nSo far, the momentum in wealth management is continuing, but it is \ndependent on animal spirits. Going into January, the expectation was that rates were coming down, \nand people were more open to putting money to work. If rates do not come down and animal spirits \nrecede, you wind up with headwinds. There is an element of uncertainty whether the first-quarter \ngrowth can be sustained.  \nTan Yong Hong \nMy final question is on capital.","hash":"b216e89ec3a42af68314a2496c32b6c7","approximate_tokens_size":472}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"You continue to accrete capital, and if the MAS \noperational risk penalty is lifted it will add 70 basis points to the capital ratio. There is also the \nadditional relief from the Basel 4 framework. How are you going to manage the excess capital in the \nshort and medium term? \nPiyush Gupta  \nWe have to keep looking for ways to return capital. Right now, we are \naccreting a lot more capital than we are paying out and it is obviously not sustainable.  \nAakash Rawat (UBS) \nThe first question is on loan growth. I think you are sounding a bit \nmore optimistic even though you are not extrapolating from the first quarter\u2019s momentum. Is the \ngrowth coming from better demand or lower repayments compared to last year?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nIt is better demand. We are still seeing higher repayments in Hong Kong. The \ndemand was from the commodity complex, both energy and soft commodities, and it was broad \nbased, including from India.  \nAakash Rawat  \nWas there manufacturing or technology as well? \nPiyush Gupta  \nThey were not a significant driver in the first quarter. In our pipeline, we are \nseeing some fairly decent demand in the energy complex, manufacturing, minerals and technology.  \nAakash Rawat  \nIt is pretty clear you need to do more in terms of dividends. Last quarter when \nI asked this question, you said that while MAS was not restricting you, the optics were not suitable \ndo a special dividend. Do you think with the MAS now lifting the pause on non-essential activities, it \nopens the door for you to do a special dividend, or would you still focus on an ordinary dividend \nincrease, including an off-cycle one? \nPiyush Gupta  \nThe truth is we not evaluated the options at the board. It would therefore be \nremiss for me to tell you how we might be thinking about it. We will evaluate it over the next few \nquarters. \nAakash Rawat \nThis could happen in the second quarter, because the board meets every \nquarter? \nPiyush Gupta  \nThere is nothing to prevent it from happening in the second quarter, but it is \nnot something we have evaluated yet.  \nAakash Rawat \nThird, some of my clients have pointed to chatter that you are going to retire \nthis year.","hash":"9a65b525609eea4512920c3abd8095bf","approximate_tokens_size":498}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Can I ask you for any comments on that? \nPiyush Gupta  \nNo, I am not retiring this year. \nAakash Rawat \nThat is great. Very good to hear.  \nThe fourth question is on the higher-rates-for-longer environment. It is good for the company, \nmargins, and the stock, but at some point it will start becoming a concern for asset quality. In the \nscenario where rates do not rise, how long will it take before your non-performing assets start \nrising? If they do rise further, at what level of rates would NPA formation start accelerating from \ncurrent levels? \nPiyush Gupta  \nI do not know the answer. I have said before that I had expected NPA to be \nhigher already 12-18 months ago, which we girded up for by building up general allowance reserves \nand overlays. It has been one of the big unknowns to me why we are not seeing a greater increase \nin NPA anywhere in the world. There has been a lot of speculation. People initially thought it was the \nfiscal support provided by governments, but it would have had run its course by now. There is an \nelement of excess money sloshing around, which has had a huge bearing on the availability of \nliquidity around the board.  \nIn our forward-looking analysis, our corporate and individual customers are looking quite resilient. \nWe are beginning to see a pick-up in unsecured consumer delinquencies. For the $115 million of \nspecific allowances this quarter, almost nothing came from the corporate book and almost all of it \nwas from the consumer book. While the consumer book delinquencies are nowhere near the levels \nof the GFC, higher interest rates are beginning to stress the consumer book. Similarly, for the SME \nand mid-cap, there has been a marginal pick-up in delinquencies but nothing to write home about.  \nIf current rates continue for another one or two years, does the other shoe begin to drop? Like I \nsaid, I have been expecting it for a year, so I would not be surprised if there was more stress. It is \nwhy we are hanging on to our excess GP reserves.","hash":"3d79da328f2a307bc37f6b59c848abca","approximate_tokens_size":468}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Aakash Rawat \nYou have some 70-80 basis points of excess allowance buffer, so why do you \nthink credit costs can go from 10 basis points to 17-20? Why would they not stay at 10 basis points \nsince you can use up the buffer to take care of any pick-up?  \nRegarding your comment on the credit cycle this time. Typically, there would be an increase in \nleverage in the early part of the cycle, which then causes higher NPA formation subsequently. It has \nbeen different this time because loan growth was negative for a while. Could it be a reason we will \nnot see systemic problems this time, although there could be idiosyncratic ones such as CRE in \nHong Kong or the US? \nPiyush Gupta  \nI have not thought about that. It could be one of the reasons. At the sovereign \nlevel, countries are much stronger, with more flexible exchange rate policies and stronger reserves. \nSystem leverage has also been lower.  \nYour other observation is also correct. We have four bites of the cherry. First, we are starting from a \nlow base of SP at 10 basis points, which gives us a cushion to the baseline 17-20 basis points we \nhave assumed in our guidance. Second, we have strong earnings \u2013 we generated $3 billion in the \nfirst quarter \u2013 so even if we had a few $100 million more in SP, we have the earnings capacity to \ntake care of it. Third, we have built up $2 billion in GP overlays. Fourth, our capital is strong. We \nhave very solid balance sheet and earnings generation, so we can absorb a lot of pain.  \nAakash Rawat \nFinally, did you mention that you are now assuming two rate hikes this year \nversus five rate cuts previously? \nPiyush Gupta  \nI mistakenly said rate hike earlier, I meant rate cut. But with Powell\u2019s latest \nstatement now, there could be even less likelihood they cut rates.  \nJayden Vantarakis (Macquarie) \nOn the outlook for net interest income, you said at the media \nbriefing that there would be a lift of $100 million from your previous guidance assuming two rate cuts \nthis year. If there are no rate cuts at all, would that number be higher?","hash":"b2e1433d031d7c807d4a06bd546ee053","approximate_tokens_size":492}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Second, is there a further \npotential lift if you can manage liabilities more proactively, since the domestic system is flush with \nliquidity and it sounds like there is not a huge loan pipeline? \nPiyush Gupta  \nIf there are no rate cuts, there would be further upside to our current \nprojection which is based on two rate cuts. On managing deposits, we have already been quite \nsensible about deposit pricing and I do not know if there are more opportunities to be sharper on it. \nWe pay 15 basis points on a large part of our savings book, while Singapore government T-bills are \nyielding 3.5-3.7%. If we want to pick up any fixed deposits, we have to match the T-bill rates or at \nleast keep them in mind. \nJayden Vantarakis  \nNow that you are the largest foreign bank in Taiwan, how much of the \nwealth fee growth is from that franchise?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nOur wealth fees grew 47% in the first quarter, with Taiwan accounting for 12 \npercentage points. We are finding a tremendous value both ways, as some Citi product capabilities \nare now available to the DBS customer base. For example, we did not have online equity trading, \nwhich Citi was providing to its customers. Citi also had much better and more robust foreign \nexchange products than we did, and we have been able to layer them on for our customers. In the \nfirst quarter, we already saw an improvement in AUM yield from our customers. On the other hand, \nCiti was not very strong in structured products, which we manufacture and is a mainstay of our \nwealth offering. We have also been able to offer bankassurance to the Citi customer base. I am \ntherefore quite energised by the upside I am seeing on both ways of the franchise. \nMelissa Kuang (Goldman Sachs)  \nI have a few questions on NIM. How did the lower Hibor \nimpact NIM during the quarter? How much fixed-rate asset repricing was there in the first quarter \nand how much will there be for the rest of the year? What do you expect for NIM trajectory next \nyear? On NPA, can you provide more colour on what drove the increase in NPA formation?","hash":"677fe820c2b65ec95a86fa2bf261a819","approximate_tokens_size":489}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Chng Sok Hui \nThe average one-month Hibor declined about 55 basis points during the \nquarter and the impact on both the group and the commercial book NIM was about minus two basis \npoints. Despite this, the commercial book NIM still expanded two basis points due to fixed-rate asset \nrepricing.  \nPiyush Gupta  \nOur total fixed-rate assets are $184 billion. It was $180 billion at the end of \nlast year, of which $16 billion repriced during the first quarter, while we also added another $4 \nbillion. The bulk of the duration we put on was between two-to-three-year tenors and gives us a \ndecent two-percentage-point lift in yields for our fixed-rate assets.  \nThis year, $40 billion of fixed-rate assets are repricing. Sixteen billion dollars happened in the first \nquarter, $11 billion will reprice in the second quarter and about $13 billion reprices in the third and \nfourth quarters. All this repricing gives us incremental yield. On the other hand, the headwinds on \nNIM come from two things. Firstly, potential rate cuts and, secondly, Casa repricing. Our deposit \nbetas were about 40% in the first quarter and will keep edging up as rates stay high. When you put \nthe headwinds and tailwinds together, our modelling suggests that we will see a marginal decline in \nNIM from last year's exit level. For next year, if you assume that there is no change to the rate \noutlook, I think the trajectory will probably be similar to this year. \nOn NPA, the drivers are idiosyncratic. For example, one of the NPA is in Myanmar where the \nunderlying company is performing well, but the government has foreign exchange control \nregulations. Therefore, they are unable to remit the money out of Myanmar, so we had to move it \ninto NPA. Another case is in India, where the joint venture between one of our clients and a UK-\nbased firm decided to unwind the joint venture as they are going into a distribution agreement, \nleading to some challenges. The third is a residential project in Hong Kong, where we have not \ntaken any SP as the loan-to-value is very low in the 20% range, but we had to move that to NPA \nbecause there was a default.","hash":"3db614a4f6ae82219b4778f92e0895c5","approximate_tokens_size":489}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"So the drivers of NPA formation are quite widespread and there is no \ntrend or trajectory. \nHarsh Modi (JP Morgan) \nA few questions. First on margins, is it fair to say that you would give \nup higher short-term NIM for longer-term NIM stability?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nThe short answer is yes. I am not managing to NIM; I am managing to interest \nincome and making sure that we have stability in that income over the next two to three years. We \ncould deploy fixed-rate assets into short-term paper issued by central banks and get a return which \nis 30-40 basis points higher than two to three-year paper. But the problem in doing that is you only \nget that return for one to two months. So, we are compromising, and we are trading-off short-term \ninterest income and NIM, to lock in rates over the longer term. We do not go too long on the yield \ncurve as it is inverted and there is uncertainty on its shape moving forward. The mid-tenors are \nmore sensible and protects our income in 2025-26 without giving up too much income in 2024. A \nrelated question you had asked before was about mortgage pricing, and we have remained quite \ndisciplined on that front. \nHarsh Modi \n \nHow many rate cuts can we have and still maintain flattish NIM over the next \none to two years?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nI do not have a specific answer. The way to think about it is that our fixed-rate \nasset book is about $184 billion, which is about one-third of our total commercial book assets of \n$530 billion. So, about one third of the commercial book is locked-in for two to three years.  \nHarsh Modi \n \nOn capital, how do you think about the pros and cons of special dividends, \nregular dividends and potentially M&A? Is there guidance on payout ratio? \nPiyush Gupta  \nThey are all good uses of capital. As you know, the M&A we have done are \nbolt-on, so the capital for M&A is small. Our capital surpluses run into several billions of dollars while \nwe continue to accrete more, so we are looking at returning capital and all options are on the table.","hash":"8cd9beece5214806ca4aaba4aa8dc3da","approximate_tokens_size":482}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"For the first quarter, even with the enlarged post bonus share base, our payout ratio was still in the \nlow 50% range. In order to return all the surplus capital, the payout needs to be much higher. At the \nsame time, our policy is architected on making sure that we can pay sustainably growing dividend \nover time.  \nHarsh Modi \n \nOver the next three years, what are the challenges that you are personally \nsetting yourself for? Will you still be at DBS three years from now? \nPiyush Gupta  \nThe way to look at it is we have a robust succession planning process at \nevery step and in every level of the organisation. You should take assurance in the fact that we have \nhad stability in our senior management and wherever we have had vacancies, we have been able to \nfill it internally. Our management committee is all home-grown as we groom and grow our own \ntalent. We move them around and we give them relevant exposure. We have achieved our record \nperformance because we have collectively worked towards it for a large number of years. So, the \ndefining questions to me are do we have enough momentum in the business, is our strategy sound, \nis our execution capability robust and is the culture in the company long lasting? I think the answer \nto all of those is yes. \nJonathan Koh (UOB Kay Hian) \nWhat drove the 19% year-on-year decline in share of profits of \nassociates and JV?  \nChng Sok Hui \nIt was driven by lower profits for NETS.  \nTan Yong Hong \nA follow up question on rates, If the US Fed were to hike by 25-50 basis \npoints, would this be net positive or negative to your earnings, considering factors beyond net \ninterest income? \nPiyush Gupta  \nIt is hard to say but I mentioned last quarter that there is a trade-off.

Meanwhile. we will also capture \nthe opportunities in securities brokerage, funds distribution and \ninsurance businesses, and strive to achieve a stable fee income for the \nfull year. \nRegarding wealth management development, Hong Kong\u2019s total AUM \nhad stood steadily above HK$31 trillion in 2023, with continued and \nhigh-volume net money inflows into private banking and wealth \nmanagement businesses. We further enriched exclusive products and \nservice experience for high-end customers, and continuously improved \nthe high-end customer service chain through close collaboration with \nvarious units within the Group such as corporate banking, our Southeast \nAsian entities and the parent bank BOC, to expand both local and cross-\nborder customer bases.
