{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Just staying, Georges, on this point on distributions and looking at the moving parts for \ncapital, one of the interesting things in this quarter was the move up in RWAs. I was wondering \nif you could give us a little bit more colour on the growth in RWAs, the $7 billion of increase \ndriven by asset quality trends. I think you\u2019re calling out that it\u2019s predominantly in Asia. What \nshould we think about the outlook for RWA growth from here, even if loan growth is muted, just \nto get a sense of the amount of capital that you will have in quantum terms for distributions? \n \nThe second question is to Noel: a question for your broader thoughts, Noel. The five years \npreceding have been pretty extraordinary, not just for HSBC but I guess for a lot of people in \nyour markets, given the pandemic. But when we look at where HSBC is now, you exited \nCanada, you announced Argentina. You\u2019re in the process of exiting quite a few smaller \nmarkets. The return on tangible equity is already in the mid-teens. You\u2019re buying back stock at \n$3 billion a quarter. You\u2019ve got a special dividend as well. I guess what I\u2019m really interested in \nis from here onwards, what do you think is left to do for the group to progress? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: I\u2019ll start with your first question, Raul. First, on RWA outlook, of the \nRWA growth we called on a quarter-on-quarter basis $24 billion. First, about 40% of it relate to \nlending and other asset growth, and as you can see from our lending book, we\u2019ve grown our \nlending book by $5 billion. There are a number of areas of growth that contributed to around \n40% of it, $9 billion. Then we\u2019ve had a $5 billion market risk RWA growth; this is due to a pickup \nin MSS activity against a subdued Q4, and it\u2019s more in line with their activity levels in the first \nthree quarters of the year, if you want. This is the normalisation of Markets activity. \n \nAnd then there is $7 billion which we classified broadly as asset quality. Now, asset quality, \nfirst, it is a continuous exercise.

I\u2019ll be making some short opening remarks before handing over to Noel. \n \nAs you may have already seen, we have announced today that Noel has informed the Board \nof his intention to retire from the bank after nearly five years in the role. The Board and I would \nlike to pay tribute to Noel\u2019s exceptional leadership during that time. As Group Chief Executive, \nhe drove both our transformation strategy as well as creating a simpler, more focused business \nthrough the disposal of assets in the US, France and Canada. This has enabled us to deliver \nan improved performance, achieving record profits last year, and create a platform for future \ngrowth and development. Noel, who you\u2019ll hear from in a second, has decided it\u2019s the right time \nto step back and find a better balance between his personal and business commitments. \n \nAs you would expect, the Board keeps succession planning under constant review. We already \nhave started a robust and rigorous process to find our next Group Chief Executive. This process \nwill look at both internal and external candidates. I\u2019m very pleased that Noel has agreed to \nremain in his role while this process takes place, ensuring a smooth and orderly transition, and, \non a personal note, I\u2019d like to thank Noel for his unwavering commitment and dedication to \nHSBC, which he joined 37 years ago. Noel, it has been a pleasure and privilege to work with \nand alongside you. \n \nNOEL QUINN, GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE: Thank you, Mark. I\u2019m very grateful for your \nsupport, guidance, friendship and partnership. I\u2019m proud of what my HSBC colleagues and I \nhave achieved together over the past five years. Over that period, we have hit some significant \nmilestones \u2013 record profits last year, the strongest returns in a decade, and the highest dividend \nsince 2008. As Mark mentioned, we have created a more focused business, and I believe we \nhave built a strong platform for the bank\u2019s next phase of development and growth.","hash":"6edb38b98f6be71f8d70452e04853436","approximate_tokens_size":500,"questions":["How has Noel Quinn's leadership as Group Chief Executive contributed to HSBC's recent record profits and strategic transformation over the past five years?","How is HSBC managing the succession planning process to appoint a new Group Chief Executive following Noel Quinn's retirement?","What strategic actions did Noel Quinn implement to simplify HSBC's business and position the bank for future growth?","What initiatives did Noel Quinn implement to achieve HSBC's highest dividend since 2008, and how will these initiatives influence the bank's financial strategy moving forward?","What role did the disposal of assets in the US, France, and Canada play in enhancing HSBC's performance and setting the stage for its future growth under Noel Quinn's leadership?","What measures is HSBC implementing to ensure continuity in its transformation strategy and sustained profitability after the retirement of long-serving Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn?","How will Noel Quinn's retirement after a 37-year career at HSBC influence the bank's long-term strategic initiatives and organizational culture?","How does Noel Quinn\u2019s decision to stay on as Group Chief Executive during HSBC\u2019s succession process benefit the bank\u2019s transition and continuity?","What strategies will HSBC employ to build on Noel Quinn's achievements and ensure continued innovation and competitiveness in the banking industry under new leadership?","How will Noel Quinn's legacy at HSBC influence the bank's future initiatives in digital transformation and technological innovation within the banking sector?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"These were primarily stage three charges across Retail and Wholesale. \nThere was a $54 million charge related to our mainland China commercial real estate portfolio. \nWhile challenges remain within the sector, we expect a more benign ECL contribution from it \nthan last year. We remain comfortable with our current level of provisions and continue \nmonitoring developments closely, and we are reconfirming our 2024 ECL guidance of around \n40 basis points of average loans, recognising the overall uncertainty from the flowthrough effect \nof high interest rates on the economy. \n \nNext, we\u2019re on track to meet our target of limiting 2024 cost growth to around 5% on a target \nbasis. This quarter\u2019s year-on-year cost growth was impacted by three items. First, we chose to \nphase the accrual of our performance-related pay more evenly this year than we did last year. \nThis accounted for two percentage points of cost growth this quarter. We do not currently \nexpect the total amount of performance-related pay for 2024 to be significantly different to 2023, \nso the accrual will be lower over the next three quarters than it was in the same period last \nyear. \n \nSecond, HSBC Innovation Banking contributed to one percentage point of cost growth this \nquarter, as we only acquired SVB UK in the middle of March last year. We intend to provide \nyou with a fuller update on that business at the half year, but I\u2019m pleased that it has good \nmomentum. In the UK, we onboarded 183 new-to-bank Innovation Banking client groups in the \nquarter, the best quarter since acquisition. \n \nFinally, another percentage point of the cost growth in the quarter was due to the Bank of \nEngland Levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment. We remain committed to cost \ndiscipline, and we are reconfirming our guidance of limiting 2024 cost growth to circa 5% on a \ntarget basis inclusive of all the above items. \n \nOn lending and deposits, there was good loan growth in the UK, the Middle East, Mexico and \nAsia excluding Hong Kong. Loan demand in Hong Kong remained subdued, largely due to the \nhigh interest rate differential with mainland China. Overall, we continue to expect \nmid-single-digit loan growth over the medium-to-long term, but we expect demand to remain \nsubdued in the near term.","hash":"690687f707f60ddb0435d0df98de81cf","approximate_tokens_size":500,"questions":["How is HSBC managing its 2024 cost growth targets in response to the $54 million charge from its mainland China commercial real estate portfolio and the integration of HSBC Innovation Banking?","What measures is HSBC taking to achieve mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium-to-long term despite subdued demand in Hong Kong and economic uncertainties from high interest rates?","How is HSBC planning to maintain its loan growth in regions like the UK, Middle East, Mexico, and Asia excluding Hong Kong while addressing the subdued demand in Hong Kong due to high interest rate differentials?","How is HSBC managing the phased accrual of performance-related pay to control its 2024 cost growth targets?","How is HSBC addressing the impact of the Bank of England Levy and the incremental FDIC special assessment in its strategy to limit 2024 cost growth to around 5%?","How is the strong onboarding of 183 new Innovation Banking client groups in the UK contributing to HSBC's overall growth strategy for 2024?","How is HSBC adjusting its expected credit loss (ECL) guidance for 2024, and what factors contribute to its projection of around 40 basis points of average loans amidst economic uncertainties from high interest rates?","How is the momentum of HSBC Innovation Banking, particularly after acquiring SVB UK and onboarding 183 new client groups, expected to influence HSBC\u2019s growth and financial performance in 2024?","How is HSBC incorporating the uncertainty from the flowthrough effect of high interest rates on the economy into its 2024 financial planning and risk management strategies?","How is HSBC ensuring the adequacy of its current provision levels and monitoring developments in mainland China's commercial real estate sector amidst ongoing challenges?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"We\u2019re glad to see that the CASA migration in Hong Kong is slowing down, but it\u2019s \nnot stabilised at this level. But on the other hand, I think the bank has seen some deposit \noutflow in Q1, while your Hong Kong local peers still see some deposit growth. So I\u2019m \nwondering if there is a strategic trade-off between the deposit growth and CASA for you at this \nstage, and how do you see that trend in the rest of the year? \n \nThe second question is on the structural hedge. I\u2019m wondering if this quarter you could share \nwith us some breakdown of our structural hedge and how much did we benefit from the \nreinvestment of the structural hedge, and if there is any run rate that we can refer to? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Jeremy. So on your first question about deposits in Hong \nKong, if you remember at Q4 our deposits in Hong Kong have increased by about $14 billion. \nWhat we\u2019ve seen in Q1 this year is a decrease of about $16 billion, therefore you can see \nseasonality playing across the two quarters and therefore is broadly stable across the two \nquarters. What happened, though, is some of these deposit inflows in Q4 related to some \ndeposit campaigns we were driving to drive some of our deposits into wealth. When you look \nat Q1, while you see the deposit outflows you also can see that $19 billion of our net new \ninvested assets were in Asia. Therefore, a chunk of these outflows has manifested or translated \ninto wealth inflows for us, which was the purpose of the campaign in Q4 and explains, if you \nwant, the seasonality of these deposits.  \n \nSecond, we have a powerful deposit franchise. We have a very cherished and enviable \nfranchise. We continue globally being a very attractive deposit proposition for both our retail \nand wholesale customers. We cherish this. We continue investing in our deposit capabilities. \nThroughout the last six quarters you\u2019ve seen how our deposit base has been very stable, with \nour deposit costs being relatively benign compared to some of our peers, therefore I won\u2019t \ncomment on month-to-month movements between ourselves and our peers.","hash":"e71c3dfea76cfd6ac2666b54923a551a","approximate_tokens_size":484,"questions":["How is HSBC strategically balancing deposit growth and CASA in Hong Kong in light of the recent Q1 deposit outflows, and what trends do you anticipate for the remainder of the year?","How has HSBC's structural hedge strategy impacted the bank's financial performance this quarter, and can you provide a detailed breakdown of the benefits from reinvesting the structural hedge, including any applicable run rates?","How does HSBC plan to sustain its stable deposit base and maintain lower deposit costs compared to its peers in Hong Kong over the coming quarters?","How did HSBC's $19 billion in net new invested assets in Asia during Q1 influence its overall strategy in the Hong Kong market, and what does this indicate about the bank's regional priorities?","What specific initiatives is HSBC implementing to enhance its deposit offerings for both retail and wholesale customers in Hong Kong, leveraging its strong deposit franchise?","How does HSBC utilize seasonal deposit campaigns in Hong Kong to convert deposit inflows into wealth management assets, and what has been the effectiveness of these initiatives in managing deposit fluctuations?","How is HSBC leveraging its ongoing investments in deposit capabilities to strengthen its competitive position in the Hong Kong banking market, and what specific enhancements are being prioritized for future growth?","How does HSBC leverage its robust global deposit franchise to generate significant net new invested assets in Asia, particularly when facing deposit outflows in the Hong Kong market?","How is HSBC adjusting its liquidity management and investment strategies in Hong Kong to address the seasonal fluctuations in deposit inflows and outflows, thereby ensuring financial stability throughout the year?","How is HSBC addressing the ongoing instability in CASA migration levels in Hong Kong, and what strategies are in place to ensure a stabilized CASA ratio in the coming quarters?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"If I move on to your second question about the structural hedge, first you would have noticed \nthat we increased this quarter the structural hedge by about $10 billion, taking it to $487 billion, \nwith the weighted average life broadly unchanged at just shy of three years. Second, we commit \nat this stage to continue our structural hedging activity. Obviously this will remain subject to \nmarket conditions, but we will continue the trend that we put in Q1 based on current market \noutlook. This activity of additional structural hedging will contribute to a mild headwind toward \nBanking NII, and this is due to the fact that the rate curves are inverted, as you know, and you \ncan do the maths. \n \nBut equally, we also are reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates, and this \nreinvestment of maturing of structural hedges at higher rates is a tailwind into Banking NII. \nBetween the two of those effects the structural hedge activity for the full-year 2024 would \nremain a net tailwind to our Banking NII. We have not yet quantified to the market that tailwind. \nWe\u2019re looking at enhancing our disclosure in this space, but that tailwind has been factored \ninto our guidance of \u2018at least $41 billion Banking NII\u2019, and obviously factored into our return on \ntangible equity mid-teens guidance.  \n \nJASON NAPIER, UBS: First of all, just to echo the best wishes, Noel, for the next chapter of \nyour career and private life; I think a well-earned rebalancing. Georges, I just wondered whether \nyou\u2019d talk a little bit within the context of \u2018higher for longer\u2019. You\u2019ve referenced subdued loan \ndemand in Hong Kong due to the differentials in interest rates, and I just wonder whether \u2013 one \nof your peers has spoken at some length about looking forward to a change in asset mix as \nloan demand comes back as a way to defend margins and revenue, so I wonder whether you \nmight talk a little bit about whether that\u2019s a material part of the plan and what you think that \nmeans for revenue evolution in the next few quarters? I think I certainly was somewhat \nsurprised that we didn\u2019t see an upgrade to Banking NII guidance this quarter.","hash":"f9abd3712836d8f7e4ceb81a354911e4","approximate_tokens_size":489,"questions":["How has HSBC's decision to increase its structural hedge to $487 billion this quarter and maintain its hedging strategy for 2024 influenced the bank's Banking NII guidance and financial outlook?","How does HSBC's strategy of reinvesting maturing structural hedges at higher rates contribute to its Banking NII and overall financial performance in 2024?","How does HSBC plan to enhance its disclosure of the tailwind from structural hedging activity, and what impact is this expected to have on investor perceptions of the bank's Banking NII and return on tangible equity for 2024?","What are the implications of HSBC maintaining its structural hedging strategy amidst inverted rate curves, and how does this approach balance potential headwinds and tailwinds to affect the bank's Banking NII in 2024?","How does HSBC's decision to maintain the weighted average life of its structural hedges at nearly three years enhance the bank's risk management strategy amidst evolving interest rate environments?","What potential risks does HSBC identify in continuing its structural hedging strategy, and how does the bank plan to mitigate these risks to ensure financial stability in 2024?","How does HSBC's significant increase in structural hedging to $487 billion enhance its competitive position in the banking industry while managing Banking NII amidst an inverted rate curve environment?","How does HSBC's strategy to reinvest maturing structural hedges at higher rates while maintaining a nearly three-year weighted average life impact the bank's liquidity and interest rate risk management for 2024?","In what ways does HSBC balance the mild headwind from increased structural hedging with the tailwind from reinvesting at higher rates to achieve a net positive impact on its Banking NII for the full-year 2024?","How is HSBC addressing subdued loan demand in Hong Kong caused by interest rate differentials, and what strategies is the bank implementing to adjust its asset mix to defend margins and revenue in the upcoming quarters?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I know you don\u2019t \nrebalance every quarter, but I just wonder whether you might talk to the role that \u2018higher for \nlonger\u2019 has on asset mix and then on credit demand. \n \nAnd then secondly, Wealth was phenomenal in Q1. I know there\u2019s a part of the business that\u2019s \nquite closely linked to what goes on with the Hang Seng Index, which is now up 20% in a short \nspace of time, but I just wonder whether you could talk to the sustainability of those run rates. \nIs that the strategy delivering the net new money flows, or is there an element of market volatility \nin there that we should be a little bit careful about? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Jason. So first on Banking NII, we recognise there are a \ncouple of encouraging developments. The first one is the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 on the rate side \nthat will look more favourable than when we discussed last in February, and the second one \nwe just touched on, which is the balance sheet mix, specifically in Hong Kong, where we\u2019ve \nseen term deposit remain stable for this quarter. So we recognise these tailwinds to our \nBanking NII, but we also recognise it\u2019s quite early in the year and these factors can still change. \nThis is why we didn\u2019t change our guidance. As you said, Jason, I don\u2019t think you should expect \nus to update our guidance every quarter. We will reconsider this every quarter, but for this \nquarter we\u2019re just sticking with our at least $41 billion. \n \nIn terms of the Wealth performance, so recognise mid-teens percentage growth in Wealth, 34% \nfor our Private Bank, I would say a couple of things. The first one is, yes, this is an area that \nwe\u2019ve already said it\u2019s a focus strategic area. We are investing in this area. A big part of our \ninvestments goes towards this area, and we\u2019re very pleased to see the results of our \ninvestments generate revenue fairly quickly. You can see that through net new invested assets \ngrowth. You can see that through our CSM, with new business CSM growth in insurance, as \nwell as in the actual revenue performance.","hash":"0d63d84a7d1320eccc590a037505dc1d","approximate_tokens_size":481,"questions":["How is HSBC's \"higher for longer\" interest rate strategy influencing its asset mix and credit demand, and what measures is the bank implementing to ensure the sustainability of its Wealth division's strong Q1 performance amidst market volatility?","How is HSBC ensuring the stability of term deposits in Hong Kong, and what effect does this have on the bank's Banking NII for the current quarter?","What initiatives is HSBC implementing in its Private Banking sector to drive a 34% growth in Q1, and how do these initiatives align with the bank\u2019s strategic investments in Wealth management?","How is HSBC strategically allocating resources between its stable Banking NII in Hong Kong and the robust growth in its Wealth management division to optimize overall financial performance for the current quarter?","How is HSBC planning to maintain its net interest income targets amid potential changes in the \"higher for longer\" interest rate environment, and what strategies are in place to sustain the recent growth in its Private Bank segment?","How is HSBC leveraging its investments in the Wealth division to enhance client satisfaction metrics like CSM, and what impact does this have on the bank's overall revenue growth?","How does HSBC plan to sustain the rapid revenue growth in its Wealth division while managing the potential risks associated with the Hang Seng Index's recent 20% surge?","Why has HSBC opted not to rebalance its portfolio each quarter, and how does this approach affect the bank\u2019s management of interest rate fluctuations and overall asset allocation strategy?","How is HSBC preparing for potential shifts in market conditions that could impact both its Banking NII and Wealth management divisions to ensure continued financial resilience?","What key factors are influencing HSBC's decision to maintain its quarterly guidance of at least $41 billion, and how might early-year economic developments affect this outlook in future quarters?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I mean, the numbers are staggering in some cases. These are the \nactivities that our business is operating on, so therefore we \u2013 while recognising that there will \nbe some interest rate challenges for borrowers at these levels, there is still a very strong \nunderlying network activity which is benefiting our overall businesses, particularly in Wholesale \nTransaction Banking and Wealth. \n \nPERLIE MONG: On that, I\u2019ve also noticed that China exports and volumes have been going \nup but value has been coming down. That is in part because of various things; FX is a big part \nof it, but also government subsidies. How does that affect your profitability in the region? Your \nvolume is going up but the value is going down. \n \nNOEL QUINN: Perlie, if I can just give you an indication, what we are seeing at the moment is \na very strong level of activity of China corporates expanding across the rest of Asia. Our \noutbound activity from mainland China to the rest of the world is seeing a significant increase \nin activity over the past 12 months. We\u2019ve seen that trend continue in the first quarter of this \nyear. A lot of people talk about inward investment into China slowing down, but what I would \nsay is outward investment from China to the rest of the world is actually picking up at quite a \npace, a very significant pace. We\u2019re very well placed to capture that outflow, and we are \ncapturing that outflow. \n \nOur business in mainland China performed well last year. It\u2019s performing well again in the first \nquarter of this year, and its outbound activity is performing extremely well. We\u2019ll give more \nupdates on that at the half year, but we are capturing that. That is why, actually, I think the rest \nof Asia is performing well on balance sheet, because a lot of it is being fed by good intra-Asia \nactivity and outbound from mainland China. \n \nKATHERINE LEI, JP MORGAN: I have three questions. The first one is on non-interest income. \nI look at the breakdown on non-interest income. It seems like Wealth is doing quite well, but on \nTransaction Banking there is some weakness. I think it\u2019s down 9% worldwide.

{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"This being said, I would just caution you not to annualise the numbers you\u2019re seeing, because \nQ1 2023 had somewhat a subdued January in it, when mainland China and Hong Kong were \nstill closed, so therefore you\u2019ve seen more pickup in activity in the Q1 2023 at the back end of \nit, whereas we had a full proper Q1 2024, so there is an element of not annualising the \nperformance, but expecting that performance to continue growing. \n \nI just realised I didn\u2019t touch on your asset mix question. Look, we do not foresee a material \nchange in our asset mix. We had seen for the last few quarters of last year the main growth \ntake place in mortgages, and recognising mortgages have seen very competitive levels both in \nthe UK and Hong Kong and the margins have been quite tight, as we start seeing pick up in \nwholesale demand, as we start seeing pick up in unsecured lending, we are more hopeful that \nthose will drive higher margins than what we\u2019ve seen in mortgages. Our numbers in Q1 did \nshow that this pick up definitely is there in areas of Asia, south-east Asia, India, the Middle \nEast, the UK, etc. The next in line for that pick up will be Hong Kong, which we expect at some \nstage later in the year as we see dollar rates ease. \n \nPERLIE MONG, KBW: Thank you for taking my question. Can I just dig a little bit further into \nJason\u2019s question just now on \u2018higher for longer\u2019? I know you probably don\u2019t like to comment on \nlonger-term NII, but in a higher-for-longer rate environment how are you thinking about the \ntrajectory going from here? It sounds to me that deposit migration has probably stabilised a lot, \nand I would have thought any lower pricing that hasn\u2019t already come through will come through \nin the next few months. In a higher-for-longer rate environment you can probably build more \nhedges at better rates as well, etc, and there\u2019s obviously a tailwind, as you mentioned, this year \nalready. How does that inform your thinking on your medium-term ROTE? That\u2019s the first \nquestion. \n \nThe second question, again, on broader activity level, maybe not just on credit.","hash":"298e9b1df7aa27b2e6d511d83324a45c","approximate_tokens_size":492,"questions":["How does HSBC plan to sustain its asset mix and profitability in 2024 by shifting focus from competitive mortgage margins to higher-margin wholesale and unsecured lending across regions like Asia, the UK, and Hong Kong?","How does HSBC expect a higher-for-longer interest rate environment to influence its medium-term Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE), particularly in relation to deposit migration stabilization and the ability to build more effective hedges?","How is HSBC adjusting its regional strategies to capitalize on increased activity in markets like Asia, South-East Asia, India, the Middle East, and the UK, and what expectations does the bank have for the upcoming pickup in Hong Kong later this year as dollar rates ease?","How is HSBC addressing the challenges of sustaining growth after the full performance seen in Q1 2024 compared to the subdued Q1 2023, particularly in regions like mainland China and Hong Kong where previous closures impacted activity?","How is HSBC planning to maintain sustainable growth throughout 2024 by leveraging the stronger activity seen in Q1 2024, while avoiding the pitfalls of annualizing the more subdued performance from Q1 2023 due to previous closures in mainland China and Hong Kong?","How is HSBC strategizing to enhance its overall margins by expanding wholesale and unsecured lending in key regions like the UK and Hong Kong, in response to the tight mortgage margins in these competitive markets?","How is HSBC planning to leverage the anticipated easing of dollar rates later this year to enhance its lending activities and margin improvements specifically in the Hong Kong market?","How is HSBC mitigating potential risks associated with shifting its growth focus from mortgages to higher-margin wholesale and unsecured lending in competitive markets such as the UK and Hong Kong?","How is HSBC planning to drive broader business activities beyond credit in key regions such as Asia and the UK to ensure overall growth and margin improvement in 2024?","How is HSBC leveraging its internal resources and strategic investments to support the anticipated growth in wholesale and unsecured lending across key regions, ensuring sustained profitability in 2024?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"I guess just \nnoting your point that Hong Kong might be the next in line to pick up, but I guess overall the \nEmerging Markets are probably not benefitting in terms of activity levels and in terms of capital \ninflows from the higher US rates. How does that impact trading activities, capital flows, etc? \nHow are you thinking about the flip side of \u2018higher for longer\u2019? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Perlie. First, yes, we recognise \u2018higher for longer\u2019 is \ndefinitely a tailwind or a reduction of a headwind we\u2019ve forecast in our Banking NII. And as I \nsaid, there have been a number of manifestations of tailwinds now compared to when we last \nspoke in February, but equally it is early in the year, and, as you\u2019ve seen, these things do \nchange. We therefore want to bake in some sense of uncertainty due to the changing \nparameters. We will update longer than what we\u2019re updating, but not at this quarter, Perlie. Do \nexpect us coming in the future quarters and give you further outlook for the future. I would say \nthe one parameter just to keep in mind as you start planning for 2025 is to take Argentina out, \nbecause obviously subject to the sale completing \u2013 which we expect to complete in the next \n12 months \u2013 that potential $1 billion contribution from Argentina will go away from our Banking \nNII. That\u2019s the most predictable parameter where we stand today as you look into 2025. \n \nIn terms of the broader activity level, first, if you look at the Wealth performance just \ndemonstrates how Wealth remains very resilient, and that\u2019s particularly true in Hong Kong, but \nvery much so across Asia. Second, when you look at our Transaction Banking activities \u2013 apart \nfrom Foreign Exchange, which has an idiosyncrasy related to Q1 2023 with a very high volatility \n\u2013 has performed across the various areas of its fee-earning activities. \n \nAnd then our activity is very much benefitting from cross-border trends; if you look at some of \nthe investments or foreign direct investments or trade flows taking place intra-region in Asia \nbetween China and ASEAN, between India and ASEAN, between India and the west, etc, all \nof those trends are growing.","hash":"700dea2f4ee343038d761990a336a12e","approximate_tokens_size":493,"questions":["How is HSBC Bank managing the impact of higher US interest rates on its trading activities and capital flows within Emerging Markets, particularly in Hong Kong?","How is HSBC Bank planning to address the anticipated $1 billion reduction in Banking Net Interest Income from Argentina in its 2025 financial strategy?","How is HSBC Bank leveraging its resilient Wealth division in Hong Kong and across Asia to sustain growth amidst declining activity levels in Emerging Markets?","How is HSBC Bank leveraging its Transaction Banking division to maintain growth in fee-earning activities despite high volatility in Foreign Exchange across the Asian markets?","How is HSBC Bank capitalizing on the increasing cross-border investments and intra-Asia trade flows to strengthen its strategic position and drive growth in the Asian market?","How is HSBC Bank incorporating economic uncertainties and evolving parameters into its financial forecasts and strategic planning for the upcoming quarters?","How is HSBC Bank leveraging the \"higher for longer\" interest rate environment to enhance its Banking Net Interest Income amidst fluctuating conditions in Emerging Markets?","How is HSBC Bank positioning itself to capitalize on Hong Kong potentially becoming the next major hub within Emerging Markets?","How is HSBC Bank balancing its growth strategies in resilient Asian markets, such as Hong Kong, against the declining activity levels and capital inflows in other Emerging Markets?","How is HSBC Bank tailoring its strategic approach in Asia to leverage its resilient divisions and capitalize on growing cross-border investment trends amid declining activity in broader Emerging Markets?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Should we triangulate this to the full year? What are the drivers to that? \nThis is the first one. \n \nThe second one is on Hong Kong. With Hong Kong relaxing LTV ratios, I think basically \u2013 not \nonly LTV, but they relaxed the purchase requirements and the stamp duty requirements on \nresidential properties, so I think there is a significant jump in transactions. I was thinking that \nthis should be positive to mortgages at least, and then we are big mortgage providers in \nHong Kong. Would that have any impact on our outlook in terms of growth, particularly related \nto Hong Kong? That\u2019s the second one. \n \nAnd then the last one, I think, is on cost.

I\u2019ll take questions one and three, and I\u2019ll hand \nover to Noel to address your second question about the outlook for Hong Kong. First, on \nnon-NII, Wealth has performed well. Transaction Banking weakness is specifically due to \nForeign Exchange. That\u2019s driving the whole weakness. The reason, as I called it out earlier, \nthe reasons that Foreign Exchange had a very strong and a record strong Q1 2023 is on the \nback of heightened market anxiety and volatility back then due to the banking crisis, so \ntherefore we\u2019re doing a comparison to a record quarter and it will show that drop, but if you \nlook at the number itself, at the revenue itself for Foreign Exchange, it is back to normalised \nlevels, so there is nothing to worry about here. It\u2019s, on the contrary, back to normalised levels.  \n \nWe continue to expect some cyclicality in that space while we continue expecting growth in the \nother areas of Transaction Banking, so I wouldn\u2019t read more than that into it. We remain very \nconfident that the investment we\u2019re putting both in Wealth and in Transaction Banking and in \nthe technology supporting our transaction banking activities do remain a strategic focus and \nare bearing results as we look into future quarters and years.","hash":"8a45342ea1f218584ef551a8775f31e0","approximate_tokens_size":482,"questions":["Based on the HSBC document, how are the recent relaxations of LTV ratios and stamp duty requirements in Hong Kong expected to influence HSBC's mortgage growth outlook in the region?","How is HSBC addressing the 8% cost increase in the first quarter to ensure it meets the annual target of 5% cost growth?","How is HSBC leveraging the strong performance in its Wealth division to offset the recent challenges faced in Transaction Banking, especially within the Foreign Exchange sector?","How is HSBC utilizing its strategic investments in Wealth and Transaction Banking technologies to drive future growth amidst the normalization of Foreign Exchange revenues?","How is HSBC planning to adapt its overall business strategy in Hong Kong in response to the recent relaxations of purchase and stamp duty requirements on residential properties?","What are the primary factors driving HSBC to extend its outlook to the full year, and how might these drivers shape the bank's strategic initiatives moving forward?","How is HSBC planning to mitigate the impact of cyclical fluctuations in Foreign Exchange revenues within its Transaction Banking division to ensure stable overall performance?","How is HSBC planning to drive growth in its Transaction Banking division beyond the Foreign Exchange sector, and which specific areas are being targeted for expansion?","What strategic initiatives is HSBC implementing within its Transaction Banking division to drive growth now that Foreign Exchange revenues have returned to normalized levels?","How is HSBC monitoring and mitigating key risks in its Transaction Banking division as Foreign Exchange revenues return to normal levels?"]}
{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"So if you consider broadly flat to be broadly a range of \nplus or minus 10 basis points, I would say UK NIM has been broadly flat for the last couple of \nquarters, and we foresee it to remain broadly flat in the next quarter. You will therefore add to \nthat broadly flat some structural hedge idiosyncrasies, which will drive you within this plus or \nminus 10 basis point range. \n \nYes, our loans and deposits have been stable. Again, the UK economy has been resilient. \nWe\u2019re very optimistic about the outlook for the UK, specifically around inflation and \nemployment. It remains a very important customer franchise for us, it remains a very important \nmarket for us, and we continue gaining market share. I mean, we continue gaining market \nshare in mortgages, with a 10% new business market share. Our back book market share has \nmoved from \u2013 or our overall portfolio market share has moved from 7% to 8%. We are 25% \nmarket share in SME lending, and obviously we continue investing in this business.

The way it works is the \nnumbers balloon with hyperinflation and then they shrink with devaluation. It depends how they \nmanifest themselves over month over month. Q4 last year has seen hyperinflation to some \nlevel, but they have seen a massive devaluation; if you recall, in December we\u2019ve seen more \nthan 50% currency devaluation. That\u2019s contributed to a disinflation of the amount that Banking \nNII in Argentina brought to Q4, and then this quarter is exactly the opposite. We\u2019ve seen 6% \nonly, but we\u2019ve seen 54% inflation, and that will just inflate the numbers. It will be volatile quarter \non quarter, and our best estimate for the full year is that it may average out to what it averaged \nout over last year, which is around $1 billion.","hash":"1f96ca92470c34cb7f0ca5158ac8512a","approximate_tokens_size":497,"questions":["How has HSBC's increasing market share in UK mortgages and SME lending reflected its confidence in the resilience and growth prospects of the UK economy?","How does HSBC's strategy to maintain stable loans and deposits, along with managing cost growth within the ring-fenced bank, demonstrate its approach to sustaining business confidence and market share in the UK?","How is HSBC addressing the economic volatility in Argentina, including hyperinflation and significant currency devaluation, and what implications does this have for its financial projections for the year?","How does HSBC's ability to maintain a broadly flat Net Interest Margin (NIM) in the UK, along with its structural hedging strategies, influence its overall financial stability and growth prospects in the coming quarters?","How does HSBC's growth in its overall portfolio market share from 7% to 8% in the UK reflect its strategic initiatives and competitive positioning within the banking sector?","How does HSBC's strategy of maintaining ring-fenced bank cost growth while investing in key areas reflect its confidence in the long-term stability and expansion of its UK operations?","How does HSBC's optimistic outlook on UK inflation and employment influence its strategic investments and market share expansion within the UK's banking sector?","How does HSBC's robust market share growth and strategic investments in the UK support its broader global banking objectives, especially in the face of economic challenges in regions such as Argentina?","How does HSBC\u2019s strategic focus on stable loans and deposits, combined with its market share growth in the UK, shape its long-term investment and expansion plans within the British banking sector?","How do HSBC's structural hedge idiosyncrasies help maintain its UK Net Interest Margin within the broadly flat range of plus or minus 10 basis points?"]}

{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"Firstly, I think the change \u2013 the stamp duty arrangements \nin Hong Kong in March in the budget \u2013 was very well received, and it\u2019s had a positive impact \non the activity levels of sales in the Hong Kong market residential sales. It was an extremely \nsignificant inflow of activity in the first month; that will be very beneficial to the liquidity positions \nof many of those developers. We have to wait and see how that stabilises, because \nundoubtedly there was an element of catch up in that first month because people were \nanticipating some change, therefore there was low activity in the preceding months. I think \nwe\u2019ve got to see how that stabilises, but I think that is a very positive move. It will enhance \nliquidity within the market, it will enhance activity in the mortgage market, but I think it\u2019s too \nearly to call it a trend at the moment. I think we need to see how Q2 stabilises following those \nchanges, but a very helpful intervention. \n \nANDREW COOMBS, CITI: Firstly, just to commend Noel as well on his five years as CEO, but \nalso to acknowledge your long stint at HSBC beforehand too. Two questions, please. Firstly, \non the UK NIM, you\u2019ve seen an improvement for a second consecutive quarter, another six \nbasis points, so outperforming some of the domestic peers. I can see your loans and deposit \nbalances look fairly flat in that entity. Perhaps you could just comment on what you\u2019re seeing \nin terms of deposit migration, mortgage re-fi, and what\u2019s driving that NIM improvement and how \nsustainable you think that improvement is going forward as well? \n \nThe second one is just a clarification on Argentina. You booked $0.5 billion in Q1, guiding to \n$1 billion for the full year based on last year\u2019s experience. Presumably what you\u2019re therefore \nsaying is a step down to $0.2 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year, given that you \ndon\u2019t expect the transaction to necessarily close until 12 months\u2019 time? \n \nGEORGES ELHEDERY: Thank you, Andrew.

{"bank":"HSBC","chunk":"On your third question about costs, first, I just want to reiterate it is a clear priority for us to \nmaintain cost discipline. We\u2019re very confident we will limit cost growth to circa 5% on a target \nbasis. We\u2019re confident about it, and we\u2019re actually on track to do so. The reason why we\u2019re on \ntrack to do so yet we showed a 7% Q1 growth on a target basis is because of a few idiosyncratic \nitems related to the quarter which are not repeated in future quarters, or some of them will \nreverse in future quarters. I\u2019ll just call the three of them out that matter. \n \nFirst, there was a 2% accrual of the performance related pay, where we decided to phase that \naccrual more evenly throughout the year than we did last year. This will manifest in a higher \nperformance-related pay accrual in Q1, hence the 2% contribution towards the 7%, but it will \ncontribute to lower accrual in future quarters because on a full-year basis we are not accruing \nto a significantly different number than the full-year 2023 performance-related pay. \n \nSecond, there was 1% contribution from HSBC Innovation Banking this quarter, because last \nyear\u2019s first quarter we only acquired SVB in the middle of March, which means we practically \ndidn\u2019t have it in the first quarter last year, and that\u2019s a base effect. \n \nThird, we had the one-offs or the expected non-recurrence of the FDIC special assessment \nadditional charge this quarter, as well as the Bank of England Levy, a new charge which used \nto be an interest expense in NII, and now it\u2019s moved to operational expense, as in costs. \nBetween the two of them they contributed to 1%. So if you adjust for those and you bake them \nin, we still remain confident to meet our 5% cost target on a full year, or circa 5% on a full-year \nbasis.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to expect NII of $10 billion to $10.25 billion \nin 2024. There are a number of factors that play here. Firstly, the currency weighted average forward \ncurve we have provided in Slide 15 of the appendices to our presentation points to reduced \nheadwinds. In February, we showed our expected currency weighted forward market rate reduction \nof 51 basis points. This is now reduced to just 12 basis points based upon the curves of April 15. Secondly, \nwe expect to see further positive impact to NII from the mechanical benefit of the short-term hedges \nrolling off. This positive impact for NII will be somewhat offset, as you would expect, by reduced client \nasset demand in a higher-for-longer rate environment.  \nSlide 5 \u2013 Engines of Non NII performing strongly \nNow turning to non-NII, which was up 37%. I will cover the product performance in more detail later \nin the segment slides, but a few comments on the non-NII performance of our core businesses.

This is booked in treasury \nproducts and arose as a result of the devaluation in the Egyptian pound. This has no impact on the \ngroup's capital position as the income is offset by a loss in the currency translation reserve.

The $60 million charge in other impairment was \nprimarily related to write-off of software assets with no impact on capital.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"So the underlying growth in Flow, which has been really good and steady through a \nperiod of time is absolutely influenced on the margin by market volatility, in particular, investors \noveractive in the markets when things are moving around. But the underlying Flow is structurally a \ngrowth story as we take market share as a top 10 and in many markets, a top 3 or top 1, Financial \nMarkets dealer across FX and rates.  \nThe Episodic by its nature is going to be fundamentally different. And the way we think about is it is \nhighly correlated with either market shocks or with a very unusual bursts of client activity or individual \nclient deals. We could sit here and say, in April or May of 2024 that there are going to be no more \nmarket shocks. But it really doesn't feel that way to me. The markets feel extremely prone to sudden \nmovements in various ways, either because of absorption shocks or because we're going through \nsome pretty key inflection points in central bank rate policy and associated currency movement.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"We're going to see all of the rest of the unfolding of it. On volumes, 2% growth in customer loans and \nadvances, Markets & Banking positive, as Bill was saying before. Of course, Mortgage is a headwind \nin terms of volumes. Also, let's remember that loans and advances are a spot measure, AIEA [Average \nInterest Earning Assets] is an average measure, that's to bear in mind. And so when you think about \nvolume, volume here comes more towards the end of the year. The liabilities mix improved during the \ncourse of the quarter. We [have] run down quite some expensive Corporate Time Deposits and other \nsources of wholesale funding. And so from that point of view, these are really the components for '24.  \nI would point out to your point on IRBB, it behoves me to recommend it given it's in our appendices \nthat we always try to use the currency weighted forward rates that we provide. We think they are \nbetter guide for all the reasons that we went through at the full year results. So I'm not going to go \nthrough them again, but those are the kind of shifts that I think help more predict how we think about \nthe development of NII. At a very high level, because the volatility of rates continues unabated, I would \nsay, if you then extrapolate out to 2025, you have the headwinds that we were expecting for 2025 are \nnow less headwinds. The hedge roll-off continues to be supportive, although to a lower level because \n \nPUBLIC \nit's going to be only $100 million next year. We continue to guide to low single-digit volume growth. \nAnd so if you do your math, you see that anything that you then get in terms of mix effect of assets \nand liabilities, is a little bit on top. That's on the NII.  \nOn the ELS securities, the way that this works is that our Board has approved a voluntary \ncompensation plan for customers.

Two parts to this. \nKorea would be the first one. I think in the annual report, you talked about a potential charge of \nseveral hundred million for the equity-linked securities. You've only taken $100 million today. Is that \nbecause the methodology from the regulator was better than you had feared at the time of the \nannual report?  \nAnd also restructuring charges, you flagged this $1.5 billion charge.

Number two, we are very, very comfortable operating \nwithin the full range of our guided CET1, so between 13% and 14%. So 13.6% especially given the \nearnings and capital generation momentum, we're comfortably in the top half of that range right \nnow.

It's a strong start it further increases our confidence in the full \nyear outcome, but it is the first quarter. And so we'll see what the world holds in store for us. I concur \nwith one of the things that you said, which is that through the resilience of our two engines of non-NII \nis very visible.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"There might \nbe others driving the other.  \nTo the second part of your question on market risk-weighted assets, an important point, and thank \nyou for raising it. We have increased market revenues over many previous quarters while substantially \nshrinking market risk-weighted assets. The link between market risk-weighted assets and Markets \nincome is not univocal. At times, there is a link, but it's difficult to drive a direct link so much so that we \nare very comfortable with what we are doing, which is currently reducing the market risk-weighted \nassets.

Diego, hopefully and extraordinarily transparently called out Africa and \nChina as two drivers of the increase in Episodic. And of course, everything is related to interest rates \nsomehow. Currencies are driven by interest rates ultimately and currency has clearly moved. But you \nknow some of what's going on in the world, and these are not primarily interest rate-driven events, \nthey're market-driven events, where the fact that we've got a very, very strong local franchise across \na large number of African markets and a very strong local franchise, not just in China, but between \nChina and all of China's major trading partners, puts us in an extraordinary position to take \nadvantage of these either market flows or dis-locations as they come up.  \n \nPUBLIC \nAnd I won't say we're unique in every regard, but I will say that the nature of our market footprint is \nunique, and that puts us in a position where we have many opportunities to \u2018score a goal\u2019 as it were \nalways by helping clients.

I'll take it and then Bill can add. I'll actually start from the bottom. What I meant, and I'm \nsorry if I didn't communicate properly, I didn't mean that there was a change in credit. I meant that \nover the course of the year, if you believe that there's going to be demand for credit, the shape of our \nrisk-weighted assets ought to move towards credit risk-weighted assets rather than just market risk-\nweighted assets. We don't see that credit risk-weighted assets today, but we hope to see more of \nthem. No issue from the point of view of credit. If anything, I would flag that the impact of credit \nmigration within our risk-weighted assets is like very low single-digit hundreds of millions of dollars in \nRWA. So no credit migration effect in our risk-weighted assets. So that's on that part.  \nOn the other, I would zoom out for a second from simply looking at the impact of expectations on \nhigher rates or on lower rates. Again, I don't want to repeat the same thing, but again, going to the \npoint of Flow and Episodic, there is a lot of the flow that when things change in the world, it's why our \nclients rebalance their liabilities, their hedges, their supply chain dynamics in terms of accounts \npayable, receivable, et cetera. All of that flows through us, and therefore, I would caution not to try to \ntie, neither Flow nor Episodic, to a simple specific indicator whether it is rates, by the way, whether it's \nthe volatility of rates, whether it is the volatility of currencies, whether it's dollar strength versus dollar \nweakness. On such a broad franchise like ours, a lot of these effects diversify themselves. Within them, \nthere are spikes, and those spikes will change, as we said.

And I think just based on current run rates and \nthe benefit of the tactical hedge into the next quarter, I know rates are less of a drag this year, but my \nback of the envelope suggests that we do need a bit of volume growth this year to get to the target \nrange. And I do note that at full year you broke out that your volume and mix was a big component \nof actually getting to the 2024 NII. But for volumes it looks like it's maybe more subdued than what we \nthought before. I'm just trying to think about if loan growth or average interest earning asset growth \ndoesn't meaningfully kick on from here and if it's kind of flattish through year-end, what's the NIM self-\nhelp that you have at your disposal? So can you help us think about what you've left to do on assets \nand liability mix that can actually lift the NIM? Is it realistic to think you \u2013can lift the NIM in the absence \nof loan growth is essentially what I'm asking.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nOkay, Aman, absolutely. So look, first of all, we don't guide on NIM anymore, and that's why we went \nto NII. We think it's simpler, but you're right. The way to think of it is we do bake into our NII walks the \npresence of volume growth. I would point out that on an underlying basis, our volume grew by 2% or \n$4 billion in this quarter, which was not an easy quarter to grow volumes. So to give up or to throw the \nsponge, as we say, on the volume growth this early is a bit early. We have many quarters to play for. \nSo let's not discount the fact that there are some green shoots for volume.  \nHaving said that, NIM is also very much a mixed story.","hash":"cae7b8e3930f6af8a86711cb6c0b5aaf","approximate_tokens_size":457,"questions":["How does Standard Chartered Bank plan to enhance its net interest margin (NIM) in 2024 despite subdued volume growth and without relying on significant loan or interest-earning asset increases?","How is Standard Chartered Bank adjusting its asset and liability mix to support net interest income (NII) growth amid challenges in volume expansion this year?","How is Standard Chartered Bank repositioning its financial strategy by focusing on net interest income (NII) rather than net interest margin (NIM) to navigate potential flat loan growth through year-end?","What role do the \"green shoots for volume\" play in Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s projections for net interest income (NII), and how does the bank plan to capitalize on these early signs of growth?","Why has Standard Chartered Bank decided to discontinue guiding on net interest margin (NIM) and focus on net interest income (NII) instead, and how does this shift influence the bank\u2019s strategic financial planning?","How is Standard Chartered Bank utilizing its asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the effects of flat loan growth on its net interest income (NII) for the remainder of the year?","How is Standard Chartered Bank incorporating tactical hedging strategies to support its net interest income (NII) in the upcoming quarter, as discussed by CFO Diego De Giorgi?","How is Standard Chartered Bank leveraging its tactical hedging and current volume growth to ensure sustainable net interest income (NII) growth for 2024 despite potential stagnation in loan volumes?","How does Standard Chartered Bank interpret its 2% ($4 billion) volume growth this quarter in terms of achieving its net interest income (NII) targets, and what strategies does the bank employ to sustain this growth amid a challenging economic environment?","How is Standard Chartered Bank planning to maintain its underlying 2% ($4 billion) volume growth in upcoming quarters to support sustained net interest income (NII) amidst a challenging economic environment?"]}
{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"The reason we're perfectly happy with this higher for longer scenario, \nbut not overexuberant, is that there's a downside to higher rates. And obviously, there's an NII upside, \nand we've called that out quite clearly. But we would expect there to be on the margin, some credit \nstresses, which is part of the reason that we're guiding to a return to our average credit loss through \nthe cycle. We're still operating well below our average right now. We don't see any problems in the \nportfolio, right. Just to be perfectly clear, it's not a forecast of issues or early warning on problems. If \nwe have a higher for longer rate environment, you would expect at some point to see that flow \nthrough to credit losses.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"So say, if you're sticking with the low single-digit loan growth \nexpectation for this year, given your efforts on treasury assets, and also the fact that the loan growth \nmight be a bit more back-end loaded this year, does that necessarily translate into low single-digit \naverage interest earning asset growth this year?

I have two questions. First, on focusing on \nthe strong aspect, which is Banking. So trying to understand this a bit better why this was so strong \nthis quarter, up 17%? So what was there in the quarter that led to increased demand from our clients \nor other banks to get this distributed loan from our side where we originated and distributed? So what \nchanged in the environment? So that we can in future model such things going forward. So that's on \nBanking.  \n \nPUBLIC \nSecond, on NII. Can you help us think whether the deposit betas have peaked, and what we are seeing \nin terms of CASA? Some back of the envelope calculations based on what you disclose on slide 18 \nseem to suggest that the CASA rate, overall blended CASA ratio just moved down in the quarter.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"In this particular quarter, it's very clear that our NIM was very much helped by what we've done in \nTreasury in terms of running off expensive CTDs, other sources of more expensive wholesale funding. \nAnd so if you wish on the self-help side, particularly in a bank that by our nature of being on a large \ngeographic footprint with  very many different markets, et cetera, and therefore, with a more active \ntreasury function, we have a number of levers that we can pull from that point of view. And of course, \nyou pointed out yourself, there is the mathematical, mechanical impact of the short-term hedge still \ncoming to our help. I would say that, that is the key. Too early to give up on volumes. Bill, is there \nanything...?  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \n \nPUBLIC \nYes, I mean Aman, I love your request for guidance on self-help. I mean the best self-help for us is to \ngrow our non-NII by 25%. That's not guidance, but that's what we did in the first quarter. And the \nmomentum is really good. So yes, of course, we should focus on NII. At current run rate, it's a little bit \nover half of our income, but only a little over half of our income and the other half is growing much \nfaster and is generating higher returns. So our self-help is very focused on generating the volume \ngrowth that we think is consistent with our business so that we can grow NII and accrete returns at \nthe same time, but the real self-help is coming by driving that non NII growth, leveraging the balance \nsheet that we're using to generate non NII. So not to be too cheeky with the answer, but sometimes I \nthink it's important to focus on the real earnings drivers of the group, which are less NII and more non \nNII even though sometimes we focus more analytically on the NII line.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nThank you, Bill.

{"bank":"Standard Chartered","chunk":"Any colour would be greatly \nappreciated.  \n<<Bill Winters \u2013 Group Chief Executive, Standard Chartered>> \nSo why don\u2019t I take a stab at the Banking question and then hand over to Diego on the NII. So the \nenvironment was supportive for us in Banking. We had a good financing pipeline coming into the \nquarter. The market environment was conducive to execution, both in high grade and high yield \nacross our markets. On Sustainable Finance, the pace of growth has slightly slowed. I would say it was \na slightly difficult beginning of the year, Sustainable Finance has been one of our biggest drivers of \ngrowth, but still substantial growth in the first quarter, contributing meaningfully to that 17% overall. \nAnd as I mentioned before, and Diego has mentioned several times, we've increased the velocity of \nour balance sheet.  \nSo the proportion of the deal pipeline that we ended up retaining on our balance sheet was relatively \nlow. And the proportion that we were able to take some fees through a continued build-up of our \ndistribution capabilities was very strong. The pipeline remains strong. The environment remains \nsupportive. And we know that's somewhat sentiment driven. I should note as well that this Banking \nline will be seasonal as are many other things in our bank, people come out of the blocks, especially \nin a year where the economic environment is looking pretty good, they come out in the early part of \nthe year, trying to get ahead of their financing plans. So we can't forecast 17% growth consistently. \nBut we had a good pipeline, we have a good pipeline, we executed well on it, and we did it in a very \nreturns-accretive way.  \n<<Diego De Giorgi \u2013 Group Chief Financial Officer, Standard Chartered>> \nOn your second question, Gurpreet, I would say that CASA-TD [ratio] is broadly where we expected it \nto be. The reason, if anything, that you see a slightly lower CASA has to do with some of the dynamics \nin terms of net new money coming in, in the Wealth business because as we flagged out to you, \nalthough the vast majority of the net new money in Wealth now comes in as Wealth products, a \nportion still comes in as deposits.","hash":"613576b38e551649a80cf0078cb546e0","approximate_tokens_size":494,"questions":["How has Standard Chartered Bank's Group Chief Executive, Bill Winters, described the impact of Sustainable Finance on the bank's overall growth in the first quarter?","According to Standard Chartered Bank's Group Chief Financial Officer, Diego De Giorgi, what factors contributed to the observed slight decrease in the bank's CASA-TD ratio?","How does Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered Bank, explain the seasonal nature of the bank's banking line and its impact on growth forecasts?","How has Standard Chartered Bank strengthened its distribution capabilities to achieve a robust fee take, as outlined by Group Chief Executive Bill Winters?","How has Standard Chartered Bank increased the velocity of its balance sheet to achieve returns-accretive execution, according to Group Chief Executive Bill Winters?","How has Standard Chartered Bank's strong financing pipeline and supportive market environment contributed to its banking performance in the recent quarter, according to Group Chief Executive Bill Winters?","Why does Standard Chartered Bank's Group Chief Executive, Bill Winters, state that the bank cannot consistently forecast 17% growth?","What reasons did Bill Winters, Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered Bank, provide for the slight slowdown in Sustainable Finance growth during the first quarter?","How did the favorable economic conditions influence Standard Chartered Bank's financing pipeline and execution strategies in the first quarter, as explained by Group Chief Executive Bill Winters?","How has Standard Chartered Bank strategically retained a low proportion of its deal pipeline on the balance sheet to enhance fee generation, according to Group Chief Executive Bill Winters?"]}

In the \nfirst quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by Markets, which resulted in a 4 \nbasis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding Markets, net interest income was relatively flat.  \nAverage loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by Loans in Spread Products in Markets, as well as Card \nand Mortgage loans in US Personal Banking, partially offset by declines in Services.

This quarter, we adjusted our FICO \ndistribution to be more aligned with industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 \nthreshold.

And we remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% \nfor our total card portfolio.

And we \ncontinue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. \nRetail Services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit \nlosses, as well as interest-earning balance growth of 9%.  Retail Banking revenues increased 1%, driven by \nhigher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins.  Expenses were roughly flat due to \nlower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit \nof approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan \nvintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the \nunprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing.  In Branded \nCards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in line with our expectations.  In Retail Services, the NCL rate of 6.32% \nwas slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range \nin the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns.  However, given the persistent inflation, \nhigher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high \nend of the full year NCL guidance range for Retail Services.

It's eliminated \nneedless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you \ncan see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, \nbut also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. \n \nSo maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive, the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and \nthat eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer, and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run \nend-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. It's \nenabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the \nbottom line and the returns driving growth, expense discipline, etcetera. \n \nWe also right-placed businesses to align with the strategy, so Banking all being under one umbrella, the \nInvestment Bank, the Corporate Bank, Commercial Bank, really helping us drive synergies there.

And it's why I started the answer \nto Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there, \nwhere the returns to do so makes sense.

{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"We've \ntalked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The \nrange that we've given on Branded Cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the \nportfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so, \nwe're watching the lower income customer profile \u2013\n or customers that we have. But again, as Jane \nmentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with. \n \nWhere we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of Retail Services. And so, there, the \ncurrent NCLs are higher than the high-end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is \nnot inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio, where the first two quarters \nare higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses \ntend to mature or materialize through that process. \n \nAnd so, I'd expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming \ndown. And then, I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off \nof these ranges.

As we see the mix evolve from \ntransactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have \nto continue to build. And so, it's why I mentioned on John's question the importance of looking at the interest \nrates, looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of \nthose things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the \nreserves. \n \nBut I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve \nlevels.

{"bank":"Citi","chunk":"I guess \nI only ask, because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we \npotentially go lower in Europe, but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your \nmanagement or make you feel better or worse about the overall NII momentum for the company? \n \nMARK MASON: Yeah, let me try and take it in, in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate \nimplieds have evolved from the 3 to 6 to now something a little bit north of 1 in the context of what I expect \nfor our performance, it doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 \nbillion. \n \nAnd in part, that's because as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally back-loaded, \nas well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate \nreduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas \ncontinue to evolve. I mentioned earlier, the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees \nare actually booked in our NII line. And so, those factors put me in a place where I feel like there will certainly \nbe puts and takes around how that rate curve evolves, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the \nguidance where it is. \n \nTo answer your broader question, in terms of kind of how we are positioned, I'd point you to the 10-K that we \nhave that's out. And in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 \nbasis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, \nfor Citi, US dollar and non-US dollar, that we're asset-sensitive. So, as rates increase, we should see an \nincrease in our NII performance. \n \nBut if you look at the breakdown and that's about \u2013  I think it was about $1.4 billion or something in terms of \nthe impact of that move.","hash":"dd859c22512ac4b45c0f7287c4edf654","approximate_tokens_size":496,"questions":["How does Citi Bank expect its net interest income momentum to be influenced by the potential divergence in global rate trajectories, particularly with rates possibly staying higher in the US compared to Europe?","How does Citi Bank's asset-sensitive strategy, as detailed in your recent 10-K, enhance its net interest income performance amidst the current global interest rate variations?","How does Citi Bank intend to navigate the impact of higher U.S. interest rates and potential rate cuts in regions like Argentina on its net interest income guidance of $80 billion to $81 billion?","How do the timing of rate changes and the incorporation of late fees in Citi Bank\u2019s card business affect the company\u2019s net interest income outlook amidst varying global interest rate environments?","How does Citi Bank's asset-sensitive approach across both US dollar and non-US dollar segments position the bank to capitalize on rising interest rates and mitigate risks from divergent global rate trends?","How do late fees from Citi Bank\u2019s card business influence the stability of the bank\u2019s net interest income amid changing global interest rate conditions?","How does the approximately $1.4 billion impact from recent rate movements factor into Citi Bank's overall net interest income outlook and strategic planning?","How does the recent policy rate reduction in Argentina influence Citi Bank\u2019s overall net interest income strategy and performance?","What factors contribute to Citi Bank's confidence in maintaining its net interest income guidance of $80 billion to $81 billion despite evolving global interest rate implications?","How does Citi Bank's expectation of maintaining higher interest rates for an extended period influence its strategies for managing net interest income and overall financial performance?"]}

I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite \ncontinued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go \nand continue to evolve.

I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know \nin the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring. And you showed \nthat was the $225 million in the quarter, and then when we look to 2Q, we should \u2013  should we still be \nexpecting a step-down in 2Q? And is that step-down just the elimination of the $225 million or is there some \nrestructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q \nto hit your annual number or is there a bigger step-down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here? Thanks. \n \nMARK MASON: Sure. I think you should just fade it, to answer your question very directly, but I'd also point \nout that in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it, and so when you \nback that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right. Despite that I'm telling you \nthe same \u2013  I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the \nend of the year and while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity \naround repositioning that plays through, so hopefully that answers your question, Betsy.

{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Edited transcript of DBS first-quarter 2024 conference call for buy and sell sides, 2 May 2024 \nNicholas Teh  \nGood morning and welcome to the analyst briefing. We can go straight to \nQ&A.  \nTan Yong Hong (Citi) \nI have two questions. The first one is on loans. The non-trade \ncorporate loan growth was great. Is it too early to take it as a sign that borrowers have accepted \nhigher rates, which would mean upside to our the low-single-digit full-year outlook?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nI think it is too early to say so. Our pipelines for the second quarter are solid, \nbut nowhere near as strong as the first quarter. So, at this point in time, we are not changing our full-\nyear guidance. If interest rates continue to stay high, it would also mean some headwinds for the \nHong Kong book as well.  \nTan Yong Hong \nMy second question is on your guidance of 6-7% for income growth and low-\n40% for the cost-income ratio. They seem to imply some slowdown in your top line and a pick-up in \nexpenses in the coming quarters.  \nPiyush Gupta  \nThe projected slowdown in the top line is due to uncertainty. Also, our first-\nquarter income tends to be stronger and the fourth quarter weaker because of seasonality. It would \nbe unrealistic to multiply the first-quarter income by four. In terms of expenses, we are keeping full-\nyear expense growth of high-single-digit. When you look at the income and expense projections, \nyou wind up with the cost-income ratio in the very low-40% area. \nTan Yong Hong \nCould the slowdown in income potentially come from non-interest income, for \nexample wealth management and treasury customer sales? \nPiyush Gupta  \nSo far, the momentum in wealth management is continuing, but it is \ndependent on animal spirits. Going into January, the expectation was that rates were coming down, \nand people were more open to putting money to work. If rates do not come down and animal spirits \nrecede, you wind up with headwinds. There is an element of uncertainty whether the first-quarter \ngrowth can be sustained.  \nTan Yong Hong \nMy final question is on capital.","hash":"b216e89ec3a42af68314a2496c32b6c7","approximate_tokens_size":472,"questions":["How does DBS Bank plan to maintain its low-single-digit full-year outlook for loan growth amidst the uncertainty in its second-quarter pipeline and the potential challenges of sustained high interest rates?","How does DBS Bank plan to mitigate the potential slowdown in non-interest income from wealth management and treasury customer sales amidst ongoing economic uncertainties?","How does DBS Bank plan to sustain a low-40% cost-income ratio while projecting income growth of 6-7% amid uncertainties and potential increases in expenses?","How is DBS Bank addressing potential headwinds in its Hong Kong portfolio if interest rates remain elevated, as discussed in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?","How is DBS Bank planning to manage its capital structure to navigate the anticipated income slowdown and rising expenses, as discussed in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?","How is DBS Bank adjusting its annual financial forecasts to account for the seasonal fluctuations in income, specifically the stronger first quarter and the anticipated weaker fourth quarter, as highlighted in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?","How is DBS Bank planning to navigate the dependence on \"animal spirits\" for its wealth management growth amidst uncertain interest rate trends, as discussed in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?","How is DBS Bank planning to diversify its income streams beyond wealth management and treasury services to ensure sustainable growth amid economic uncertainties, as discussed in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?","What strategies is DBS Bank employing to sustain high-single-digit expense growth while anticipating a potential slowdown in income, as discussed in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?","What strategies is DBS Bank implementing to optimize its lending practices in response to sustained high interest rates and the economic uncertainties highlighted in the first-quarter 2024 conference call?"]}

Why would they not stay at 10 basis points \nsince you can use up the buffer to take care of any pick-up?  \nRegarding your comment on the credit cycle this time. Typically, there would be an increase in \nleverage in the early part of the cycle, which then causes higher NPA formation subsequently. It has \nbeen different this time because loan growth was negative for a while. Could it be a reason we will \nnot see systemic problems this time, although there could be idiosyncratic ones such as CRE in \nHong Kong or the US? \nPiyush Gupta  \nI have not thought about that. It could be one of the reasons. At the sovereign \nlevel, countries are much stronger, with more flexible exchange rate policies and stronger reserves. \nSystem leverage has also been lower.  \nYour other observation is also correct. We have four bites of the cherry. First, we are starting from a \nlow base of SP at 10 basis points, which gives us a cushion to the baseline 17-20 basis points we \nhave assumed in our guidance.

I think you are sounding a bit \nmore optimistic even though you are not extrapolating from the first quarter\u2019s momentum.

On managing deposits, we have already been quite \nsensible about deposit pricing and I do not know if there are more opportunities to be sharper on it. \nWe pay 15 basis points on a large part of our savings book, while Singapore government T-bills are \nyielding 3.5-3.7%.

We are finding a tremendous value both ways, as some Citi product capabilities \nare now available to the DBS customer base. For example, we did not have online equity trading, \nwhich Citi was providing to its customers.

{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Chng Sok Hui \nThe average one-month Hibor declined about 55 basis points during the \nquarter and the impact on both the group and the commercial book NIM was about minus two basis \npoints. Despite this, the commercial book NIM still expanded two basis points due to fixed-rate asset \nrepricing.  \nPiyush Gupta  \nOur total fixed-rate assets are $184 billion. It was $180 billion at the end of \nlast year, of which $16 billion repriced during the first quarter, while we also added another $4 \nbillion. The bulk of the duration we put on was between two-to-three-year tenors and gives us a \ndecent two-percentage-point lift in yields for our fixed-rate assets.  \nThis year, $40 billion of fixed-rate assets are repricing. Sixteen billion dollars happened in the first \nquarter, $11 billion will reprice in the second quarter and about $13 billion reprices in the third and \nfourth quarters. All this repricing gives us incremental yield. On the other hand, the headwinds on \nNIM come from two things. Firstly, potential rate cuts and, secondly, Casa repricing. Our deposit \nbetas were about 40% in the first quarter and will keep edging up as rates stay high. When you put \nthe headwinds and tailwinds together, our modelling suggests that we will see a marginal decline in \nNIM from last year's exit level. For next year, if you assume that there is no change to the rate \noutlook, I think the trajectory will probably be similar to this year. \nOn NPA, the drivers are idiosyncratic. For example, one of the NPA is in Myanmar where the \nunderlying company is performing well, but the government has foreign exchange control \nregulations. Therefore, they are unable to remit the money out of Myanmar, so we had to move it \ninto NPA. Another case is in India, where the joint venture between one of our clients and a UK-\nbased firm decided to unwind the joint venture as they are going into a distribution agreement, \nleading to some challenges. The third is a residential project in Hong Kong, where we have not \ntaken any SP as the loan-to-value is very low in the 20% range, but we had to move that to NPA \nbecause there was a default.","hash":"3db614a4f6ae82219b4778f92e0895c5","approximate_tokens_size":489,"questions":["How has DBS Bank's strategy of repricing fixed-rate assets contributed to the expansion of its commercial book net interest margin (NIM) despite the decline in the average one-month Hibor?","What strategies is DBS Bank implementing to address the rise in non-performing assets (NPA) related to international challenges in regions such as Myanmar, India, and Hong Kong?","How is DBS Bank's management of deposit betas amidst sustained high interest rates expected to influence its net interest margin (NIM) outlook, and what factors are included in the bank's modeling for anticipating a marginal decline from last year's exit level?","How is DBS Bank's strategy of spacing out the repricing of $40 billion in fixed-rate assets throughout the year contributing to a two-percentage-point increase in yields, and what specific tenor durations is the bank focusing on to achieve this lift?","What strategies is DBS Bank employing to balance the incremental yields from repricing its fixed-rate assets with the headwinds posed by CASA repricing and potential interest rate cuts to maintain its net interest margin (NIM)?","How does DBS Bank's strategy of maintaining low loan-to-value ratios in its Hong Kong residential projects help mitigate the need for special provisions when managing non-performing assets?","How does DBS Bank's strategy of gradually increasing its fixed-rate assets to $184 billion, with targeted repricing in two-to-three-year tenors, enhance the bank's yield performance and support its financial objectives in the current interest rate environment?","How does DBS Bank's addition of $4 billion to its fixed-rate assets in the first quarter enhance its yield performance and contribute to the expansion of its net interest margin?","How does DBS Bank's phased approach to repricing $40 billion in fixed-rate assets throughout the year support its yield performance and financial stability amid declining Hibor rates and rising CASA repricing pressures?","How is DBS Bank planning to mitigate the projected marginal decline in its net interest margin (NIM) to sustain profitability and support strategic initiatives in the upcoming fiscal year?"]}
{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"So the drivers of NPA formation are quite widespread and there is no \ntrend or trajectory. \nHarsh Modi (JP Morgan) \nA few questions. First on margins, is it fair to say that you would give \nup higher short-term NIM for longer-term NIM stability?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nThe short answer is yes. I am not managing to NIM; I am managing to interest \nincome and making sure that we have stability in that income over the next two to three years. We \ncould deploy fixed-rate assets into short-term paper issued by central banks and get a return which \nis 30-40 basis points higher than two to three-year paper. But the problem in doing that is you only \nget that return for one to two months. So, we are compromising, and we are trading-off short-term \ninterest income and NIM, to lock in rates over the longer term. We do not go too long on the yield \ncurve as it is inverted and there is uncertainty on its shape moving forward. The mid-tenors are \nmore sensible and protects our income in 2025-26 without giving up too much income in 2024. A \nrelated question you had asked before was about mortgage pricing, and we have remained quite \ndisciplined on that front. \nHarsh Modi \n \nHow many rate cuts can we have and still maintain flattish NIM over the next \none to two years?  \nPiyush Gupta  \nI do not have a specific answer. The way to think about it is that our fixed-rate \nasset book is about $184 billion, which is about one-third of our total commercial book assets of \n$530 billion. So, about one third of the commercial book is locked-in for two to three years.  \nHarsh Modi \n \nOn capital, how do you think about the pros and cons of special dividends, \nregular dividends and potentially M&A? Is there guidance on payout ratio? \nPiyush Gupta  \nThey are all good uses of capital. As you know, the M&A we have done are \nbolt-on, so the capital for M&A is small. Our capital surpluses run into several billions of dollars while \nwe continue to accrete more, so we are looking at returning capital and all options are on the table.","hash":"8cd9beece5214806ca4aaba4aa8dc3da","approximate_tokens_size":482,"questions":["How is DBS Bank prioritizing long-term NIM stability over short-term NIM gains to ensure consistent interest income, as explained by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How does DBS Bank plan to utilize its capital surpluses, including options like special dividends, regular dividends, and mergers and acquisitions, as outlined by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How is DBS Bank balancing its fixed-rate asset holdings and interest rate strategies to ensure stable net interest margins amid an inverted yield curve, as explained by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How is DBS Bank maintaining disciplined mortgage pricing to ensure financial stability, as discussed by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How is DBS Bank addressing the widespread and unpredictable drivers of NPA formation in the absence of clear trends, as highlighted by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How is DBS Bank utilizing mid-tenor fixed-rate investments to safeguard its interest income through 2025-26 while mitigating risks associated with an inverted yield curve, according to CEO Piyush Gupta?","How is DBS Bank strategically limiting the duration of its fixed-rate investments to respond to an inverted yield curve and ensure income stability, as explained by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How is DBS Bank leveraging its fixed-rate asset portfolio to sustain a stable net interest margin (NIM) amidst potential rate cuts over the next one to two years, as explained by CEO Piyush Gupta?","How does DBS Bank's strategy of prioritizing long-term income stability over short-term net interest margin gains influence its overall interest income management, according to CEO Piyush Gupta?","Why is DBS Bank opting against deploying fixed-rate assets into short-term central bank-issued papers despite the potential for higher temporary returns, and how does this choice support the bank's long-term income stability, as explained by CEO Piyush Gupta?"]}

{"bank":"DBS","chunk":"Can I ask you for any comments on that? \nPiyush Gupta  \nNo, I am not retiring this year. \nAakash Rawat \nThat is great. Very good to hear.  \nThe fourth question is on the higher-rates-for-longer environment. It is good for the company, \nmargins, and the stock, but at some point it will start becoming a concern for asset quality. In the \nscenario where rates do not rise, how long will it take before your non-performing assets start \nrising? If they do rise further, at what level of rates would NPA formation start accelerating from \ncurrent levels? \nPiyush Gupta  \nI do not know the answer. I have said before that I had expected NPA to be \nhigher already 12-18 months ago, which we girded up for by building up general allowance reserves \nand overlays. It has been one of the big unknowns to me why we are not seeing a greater increase \nin NPA anywhere in the world. There has been a lot of speculation. People initially thought it was the \nfiscal support provided by governments, but it would have had run its course by now. There is an \nelement of excess money sloshing around, which has had a huge bearing on the availability of \nliquidity around the board.  \nIn our forward-looking analysis, our corporate and individual customers are looking quite resilient. \nWe are beginning to see a pick-up in unsecured consumer delinquencies. For the $115 million of \nspecific allowances this quarter, almost nothing came from the corporate book and almost all of it \nwas from the consumer book. While the consumer book delinquencies are nowhere near the levels \nof the GFC, higher interest rates are beginning to stress the consumer book.
